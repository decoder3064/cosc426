[Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his mother	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Countess, and Helen, Lord Lafew, all in black.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  In delivering my son from me, I bury a second	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
husband.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  And I in going, madam, weep o'er my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
father's death anew; but I must attend his Majesty's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in subjection.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  You shall find of the King a husband, madam;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted	shakespeare	swift	0
rather than lack it where there is such abundance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  What hope is there of his Majesty's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
amendment?	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
under whose practices he hath persecuted time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with hope, and finds no other advantage in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
process but only the losing of hope by time.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  This young gentlewoman had a father--O,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that "had," how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill	shakespeare	swift	0
was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
so far, would have made nature immortal, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
death should have play for lack of work. Would for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the King's sake he were living! I think it would be	shakespeare	swift	0
the death of the King's disease.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  How called you the man you speak of,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
madam?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  He was excellent indeed, madam. The King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He was skillful enough to have lived still, if	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knowledge could be set up against mortality.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  What is it, my good lord, the King languishes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  A fistula, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I heard not of it before.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I would it were not notorious.--Was this gentlewoman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that her education promises. Her dispositions she	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
commendations go with pity--they are virtues and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She derives her honesty and achieves her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
goodness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Your commendations, madam, get from her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tears.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
praise in. The remembrance of her father never	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
takes all livelihood from her cheek.--No	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,	shakespeare	swift	0
excessive grief the enemy to the living.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  If the living be enemy to the grief, the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
excess makes it soon mortal.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Madam, I desire your holy wishes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  How understand we that?	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In manners as in shape. Thy blood and virtue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under thy own life's key Be checked for silence,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fall on thy head. [To Lafew.] Farewell, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis an unseasoned courtier. Good my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Advise him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  He cannot want the best that shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Attend his love.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Heaven bless him.--Farewell, Bertram.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  The best wishes that can be forged in your	shakespeare	swift	0
thoughts be servants to you. [Countess exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Helen.] Be comfortable to my mother, your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mistress, and make much of her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of your father.  [Bertram and Lafew exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
O, were that all! I think not on my father,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And these great tears grace his remembrance more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have forgot him. My imagination	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Carries no favor in 't but Bertram's.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am undone. There is no living, none,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one	shakespeare	swift	0
That I should love a bright particular star	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And think to wed it, he is so above me.	shakespeare	swift	0
In his bright radiance and collateral light	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The hind that would be mated by the lion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To see him every hour, to sit and draw	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In our heart's table--heart too capable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy	shakespeare	swift	0
Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One that goes with him. I love him for his sake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet I know him a notorious liar,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That they take place when virtue's steely bones	shakespeare	swift	0
Looks bleak i' th' cold wind. Withal, full oft we see	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Save you, fair queen.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  And you, monarch.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  No.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  And no.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Are you meditating on virginity?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How may we barricado it against him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Keep him out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  But he assails, and our virginity, though	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
some warlike resistance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  There is none. Man setting down before you	shakespeare	swift	0
will undermine you and blow you up.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Bless our poor virginity from underminers and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
might blow up men?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Virginity being blown down, man will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
down again, with the breach yourselves made you	shakespeare	swift	0
lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth	shakespeare	swift	0
of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is rational increase, and there was never	shakespeare	swift	0
virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you	shakespeare	swift	0
were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
being once lost may be ten times found; by being	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ever kept, it is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion.	shakespeare	swift	0
Away with 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
die a virgin.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  There's little can be said in 't. 'Tis against the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
virginity murders itself and should be buried in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
't. Out with 't! Within ten year it will make itself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
itself not much the worse. Away with 't!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
liking?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne'er	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
like an old courtier, wears her cap out of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the	shakespeare	swift	0
brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your date is better in your pie and your porridge	shakespeare	swift	0
than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
virginity, is like one of our French withered pears:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it looks ill, it eats dryly; marry, 'tis a withered pear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It was formerly better, marry, yet 'tis a withered	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pear. Will you anything with it?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Not my virginity, yet--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There shall your master have a thousand loves,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A counselor, a traitress, and a dear;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His humble ambition, proud humility,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of pretty, fond adoptious christendoms	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I know not what he shall. God send him well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The court's a learning place, and he is one--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  What one, i' faith?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  That I wish well. 'Tis pity--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  What's pity?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
That wishing well had not a body in 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Might with effects of them follow our friends	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And show what we alone must think, which never	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Returns us thanks.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PAGE  Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember	shakespeare	swift	0
thee, I will think of thee at court.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a	shakespeare	swift	0
charitable star.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Under Mars, I.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  I especially think under Mars.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Why under Mars?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  The wars hath so kept you under that you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
must needs be born under Mars.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  When he was predominant.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  When he was retrograde, I think rather.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Why think you so?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  You go so much backward when you fight.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  That's for advantage.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  So is running away, when fear proposes the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
safety. But the composition that your valor and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
like the wear well.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I am so full of businesses I cannot answer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
which my instruction shall serve to naturalize	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and understand what advice shall thrust upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Parolles and Page exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Impossible be strange attempts to those	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Flourish cornets. Enter the King of France with letters,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
two Lords, and divers Attendants.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have fought with equal fortune, and continue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A braving war.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  So 'tis reported, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A certainty vouched from our cousin Austria,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With caution that the Florentine will move us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prejudicates the business and would seem	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To have us make denial.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  His love and wisdom,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Approved so to your Majesty, may plead	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For amplest credence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  He hath armed our answer,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And Florence is denied before he comes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To stand on either part.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  It well may serve	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For breathing and exploit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  What's he comes here?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is the Count Rossillion, my good lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Young Bertram.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mayst thou inherit too. Welcome to Paris.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would I had that corporal soundness now	shakespeare	swift	0
As when thy father and myself in friendship	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
First tried our soldiership. He did look far	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Into the service of the time and was	shakespeare	swift	0
Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But on us both did haggish age steal on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To talk of your good father. In his youth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He had the wit which I can well observe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Today in our young lords; but they may jest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ere they can hide their levity in honor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His equal had awaked them, and his honor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Exception bid him speak, and at this time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His tongue obeyed his hand. Who were below him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He used as creatures of another place	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Making them proud of his humility,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Might be a copy to these younger times,	shakespeare	swift	0
Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But goers backward.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  His good remembrance, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So in approof lives not his epitaph	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As in your royal speech.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would I were with him! He would always say--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He scattered not in ears, but grafted them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To grow there and to bear. "Let me not live"--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This his good melancholy oft began	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When it was out--"Let me not live," quoth he,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All but new things disdain, whose judgments are	shakespeare	swift	0
Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Expire before their fashions." This he wished.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I, after him, do after him wish too,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I quickly were dissolved from my hive	shakespeare	swift	0
To give some laborers room.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  You're loved, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I fill a place, I know 't.--How long is 't, count,	shakespeare	swift	0
Since the physician at your father's died?	shakespeare	swift	0
He was much famed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Some six months since, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If he were living, I would try him yet.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lend me an arm.--The rest have worn me out	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With several applications. Nature and sickness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count.	shakespeare	swift	0
My son's no dearer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

COUNTESS  I will now hear. What say you of this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gentlewoman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD  Madam, the care I have had to even your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
content I wish might be found in the calendar of	shakespeare	swift	0
my past endeavors, for then we wound our modesty	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and make foul the clearness of our deservings	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when of ourselves we publish them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  What does this knave here? [To Fool.] Get	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of	shakespeare	swift	0
you I do not all believe. 'Tis my slowness that I do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and have ability enough to make such knaveries	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yours.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fellow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Well, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
though many of the rich are damned. But if I may	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have your Ladyship's good will to go to the world,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Wilt thou needs be a beggar?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I do beg your good will in this case.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  In what case?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and I think I shall never have the blessing of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
God till I have issue o' my body, for they say bairns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
are blessings.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drives.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  Is this all your Worship's reason?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
as they are.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  May the world know them?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and all flesh and blood are, and indeed I do marry	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that I may repent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
friends for my wife's sake.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Such friends are thine enemies, knave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  You're shallow, madam, in great friends, for the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of. He that ears my land spares my team and gives	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my flesh and blood is my friend. Ergo, he that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to be what they are, there were no fear in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
marriage, for young Charbon the Puritan and old	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Poysam the Papist, howsome'er their hearts are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
severed in religion, their heads are both one; they	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
calumnious knave?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  A prophet I, madam, and I speak the truth the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
next way:	shakespeare	swift	0
[Sings.] For I the ballad will repeat	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which men full true shall find:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your marriage comes by destiny;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your cuckoo sings by kind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Get you gone, sir. I'll talk with you more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
anon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD  May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
come to you. Of her I am to speak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with her--Helen, I mean.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"Was this fair face the cause," quoth she,	shakespeare	swift	0
"Why the Grecians sacked Troy?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fond done, done fond.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was this King Priam's joy?"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

With that she sighed as she stood,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

"Among nine bad if one be good,	shakespeare	swift	0
Among nine bad if one be good,	shakespeare	swift	0
There's yet one good in ten."	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  What, one good in ten? You corrupt the	shakespeare	swift	0
song, sirrah.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  One good woman in ten, madam, which is a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
purifying o' th' song. Would God would serve the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
world so all the year! We'd find no fault with the	shakespeare	swift	0
tithe-woman if I were the parson. One in ten,	shakespeare	swift	0
quoth he? An we might have a good woman born	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but or every blazing star or at an earthquake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'twould mend the lottery well. A man may draw his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heart out ere he pluck one.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you!	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  That man should be at woman's command, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no Puritan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am	shakespeare	swift	0
going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hither. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Well, now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD  I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman	shakespeare	swift	0
entirely.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me, and she herself, without other advantage, may	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lawfully make title to as much love as she finds.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There is more owing her than is paid, and more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shall be paid her than she'll demand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD  Madam, I was very late more near her than I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
think she wished me. Alone she was and did communicate	shakespeare	swift	0
to herself her own words to her own	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not any stranger sense. Her matter was she loved	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
had put such difference betwixt their two estates;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Love no god, that would not extend his might only	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that would suffer her poor knight surprised	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This she delivered in the most bitter touch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in, which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you something to know it.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  You have discharged this honestly. Keep it	shakespeare	swift	0
to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
before, which hung so tott'ring in the balance that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
leave me. Stall this in your bosom, and I thank you	shakespeare	swift	0
for your honest care. I will speak with you further	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
anon. [Steward exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Aside.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Even so it was with me when I was young.	shakespeare	swift	0
If ever we are nature's, these are ours. This thorn	shakespeare	swift	0
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where love's strong passion is impressed in youth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By our remembrances of days foregone,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her eye is sick on 't, I observe her now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  What is your pleasure, madam?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Mine honorable mistress.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Nay, a mother.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why not a mother? When I said "a mother,"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methought you saw a serpent. What's in "mother"	shakespeare	swift	0
That you start at it? I say I am your mother	shakespeare	swift	0
And put you in the catalogue of those	shakespeare	swift	0
That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You ne'er oppressed me with a mother's groan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet I express to you a mother's care.	shakespeare	swift	0
God's mercy, maiden, does it curd thy blood	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That this distempered messenger of wet,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The many-colored Iris, rounds thine eye?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why? That you are my daughter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  That I am not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
I say I am your mother.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Pardon, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Count Rossillion cannot be my brother.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am from humble, he from honored name;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No note upon my parents, his all noble.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My master, my dear lord he is, and I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His servant live and will his vassal die.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He must not be my brother.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Nor I your mother?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
You are my mother, madam. Would you were--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So that my lord your son were not my brother--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I care no more for than I do for heaven,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So I were not his sister. Can 't no other	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.	shakespeare	swift	0
God shield you mean it not! "Daughter" and "mother"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My fear hath catched your fondness! Now I see	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The mystery of your loneliness and find	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You love my son. Invention is ashamed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against the proclamation of thy passion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But tell me then 'tis so, for, look, thy cheeks	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Confess it th' one to th' other, and thine eyes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That in their kind they speak it. Only sin	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That truth should be suspected. Speak. Is 't so?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If it be not, forswear 't; howe'er, I charge thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To tell me truly.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Good madam, pardon me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Go not about. My love hath in 't a bond	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The state of your affection, for your passions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have to the full appeached.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [kneeling]  Then I confess	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here on my knee before high heaven and you	shakespeare	swift	0
That before you and next unto high heaven	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I love your son.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My friends were poor but honest; so 's my love.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be not offended, for it hurts not him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That he is loved of me. I follow him not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By any token of presumptuous suit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet never know how that desert should be.	shakespeare	swift	0
I know I love in vain, strive against hope,	shakespeare	swift	0
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve	shakespeare	swift	0
I still pour in the waters of my love	shakespeare	swift	0
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Religious in mine error, I adore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The sun that looks upon his worshipper	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let not your hate encounter with my love	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For loving where you do; but if yourself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did ever in so true a flame of liking	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian	shakespeare	swift	0
Was both herself and Love, O then give pity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To her whose state is such that cannot choose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That seeks not to find that her search implies,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Had you not lately an intent--speak truly--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

COUNTESS  Wherefore?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tell true.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [standing]	shakespeare	swift	0
I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You know my father left me some prescriptions	shakespeare	swift	0
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And manifest experience had collected	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For general sovereignty; and that he willed me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As notes whose faculties inclusive were	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
More than they were in note. Amongst the rest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There is a remedy, approved, set down,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To cure the desperate languishings whereof	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The King is rendered lost.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
This was your motive for Paris, was it? Speak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
My lord your son made me to think of this;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Had from the conversation of my thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Haply been absent then.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  But think you, Helen,	shakespeare	swift	0
If you should tender your supposed aid,	shakespeare	swift	0
He would receive it? He and his physicians	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are of a mind: he that they cannot help him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They that they cannot help. How shall they credit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Emboweled of their doctrine have left off	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The danger to itself?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  There's something in 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
More than my father's skill, which was the great'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of his profession, that his good receipt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall for my legacy be sanctified	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and would your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But give me leave to try success, I'd venture	shakespeare	swift	0
The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By such a day, an hour.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Dost thou believe 't?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Ay, madam, knowingly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Means and attendants, and my loving greetings	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Health at your bidding serve your Majesty!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Those girls of Italy, take heed of them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They say our French lack language to deny	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If they demand. Beware of being captives	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Before you serve.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORDS  Our hearts receive your warnings.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Farewell.--Come hither to me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[The King speaks to Attendants, while Bertram,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Parolles, and other Lords come forward.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [to Bertram]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

'Tis not his fault, the spark.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  O, 'tis brave wars.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
Most admirable. I have seen those wars.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I am commanded here and kept a coil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With "Too young," and "The next year," and "'Tis	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
too early."	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till honor be bought up, and no sword worn	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's honor in the theft.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Commit it, count.	shakespeare	swift	0
SECOND LORD	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am your accessory. And so, farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
body.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST LORD  Farewell, captain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Sweet Monsieur Parolles.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Captain Spurio with his cicatrice, an emblem of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
war, here on his sinister cheek. It was this very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sword entrenched it. Say to him I live, and observe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his reports for me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  We shall, noble captain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Mars dote on you for his novices.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Lords exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Bertram.] What will you do?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Stay the King.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lords. You have restrained yourself within the list	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for they wear themselves in the cap of the time;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
under the influence of the most received star, and,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
though the devil lead the measure, such are to be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
followed. After them, and take a more dilated	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  And I will do so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Worthy fellows, and like to prove most	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sinewy swordmen. [Bertram and Parolles exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Lafew, to the King.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [kneeling]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  I'll fee thee to stand up.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [standing]	shakespeare	swift	0
Then here's a man stands that has brought his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pardon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would I had, so I had broke thy pate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And asked thee mercy for 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Good faith, across.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cured	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of your infirmity?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  No.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  O, will you eat	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Could reach them. I have seen a medicine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That's able to breathe life into a stone,	shakespeare	swift	0
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary	shakespeare	swift	0
With sprightly fire and motion, whose simple touch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To give great Charlemagne a pen in 's hand	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And write to her a love line.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  What "her" is this?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, Doctor She. My lord, there's one arrived,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If seriously I may convey my thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With one that in her sex, her years, profession,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wisdom, and constancy hath amazed me more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For that is her demand--and know her business?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That done, laugh well at me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Now, good Lafew,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bring in the admiration, that we with thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By wond'ring how thou took'st it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Nay, I'll fit you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And not be all day neither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He goes to bring in Helen.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Helen.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [to Helen]  Nay, come your ways.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  This haste hath wings indeed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Nay, come your ways.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is his Majesty. Say your mind to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A traitor you do look like, but such traitors	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That dare leave two together. Fare you well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Ay, my good lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Gerard de Narbon was my father,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In what he did profess well found.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  I knew him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
The rather will I spare my praises towards him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Knowing him is enough. On 's bed of death	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Many receipts he gave me, chiefly one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And of his old experience th' only darling,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He bade me store up as a triple eye,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And hearing your high Majesty is touched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With that malignant cause wherein the honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I come to tender it and my appliance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With all bound humbleness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  We thank you, maiden,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But may not be so credulous of cure,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When our most learned doctors leave us and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The congregated college have concluded	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That laboring art can never ransom nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From her inaidible estate. I say we must not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To prostitute our past-cure malady	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To empirics, or to dissever so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our great self and our credit to esteem	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
My duty, then, shall pay me for my pains.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will no more enforce mine office on you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A modest one to bear me back again.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I cannot give thee less, to be called grateful.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou thought'st to help me, and such thanks I give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As one near death to those that wish him live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
What I can do can do no hurt to try	shakespeare	swift	0
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He that of greatest works is finisher	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Oft does them by the weakest minister.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From simple sources, and great seas have dried	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When miracles have by the great'st been denied.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Oft expectation fails, and most oft there	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where most it promises, and oft it hits	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where hope is coldest and despair most shifts.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy pains, not used, must by thyself be paid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Inspired merit so by breath is barred.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is not so with Him that all things knows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But most it is presumption in us when	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The help of heaven we count the act of men.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am not an impostor that proclaim	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Myself against the level of mine aim,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But know I think and think I know most sure	shakespeare	swift	0
My art is not past power nor you past cure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Art thou so confident? Within what space	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hop'st thou my cure?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  The greatest grace lending grace,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Moist Hesperus hath quenched her sleepy lamp;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath told the thievish minutes, how they pass,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon thy certainty and confidence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What dar'st thou venture?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Tax of impudence,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Traduced by odious ballads, my maiden's name	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Seared otherwise; nay, worse of worst, extended	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With vilest torture let my life be ended.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His powerful sound within an organ weak,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And what impossibility would slay	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In common sense, sense saves another way.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That happiness and prime can happy call.	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sweet practicer, thy physic I will try,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That ministers thine own death if I die.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
If I break time or flinch in property	shakespeare	swift	0
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And well deserved. Not helping, death's my fee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But if I help, what do you promise me?	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make thy demand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  But will you make it even?	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What husband in thy power I will command.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Exempted be from me the arrogance	shakespeare	swift	0
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My low and humble name to propagate	shakespeare	swift	0
With any branch or image of thy state;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here is my hand. The premises observed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy will by my performance shall be served.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
More should I question thee, and more I must,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though more to know could not be more to trust:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From whence thou cam'st, how tended on; but rest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unquestioned welcome and undoubted blessed.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Give me some help here, ho!--If thou proceed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Countess and Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Come on, sir. I shall now put you to the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
height of your breeding.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
know my business is but to the court.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  "To the court"? Why, what place make you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
special when you put off that with such contempt?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"But to the court"?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
make a leg, put off 's cap, kiss his hand, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not for the court. But, for me, I have an answer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will serve all men.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all	shakespeare	swift	0
questions.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks:	shakespeare	swift	0
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock,	shakespeare	swift	0
or any buttock.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Will your answer serve fit to all questions?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
as your French crown for your taffety punk, as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tib's rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May Day, as the nail	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for all questions?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  From below your duke to beneath your constable,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it will fit any question.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  It must be an answer of most monstrous	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
size that must fit all demands.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
belongs to 't. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you no harm to learn.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  To be young again, if we could! I will be a	shakespeare	swift	0
fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O Lord, sir!--There's a simple putting off. More,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more, a hundred of them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Sir, I am a poor friend of yours that loves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Thick, thick. Spare not me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
meat.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Nay, put me to 't, I warrant you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Spare not me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Do you cry "O Lord, sir!" at your whipping,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and "spare not me"? Indeed your "O Lord, sir!" is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
very sequent to your whipping. You would answer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
very well to a whipping if you were but bound to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my "O Lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sir!" I see things may serve long but not serve ever.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  I play the noble huswife with the time to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
entertain it so merrily with a fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O Lord, sir!--Why, there 't serves well again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS, [giving him a paper]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
An end, sir. To your business. Give Helen this,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Commend me to my kinsmen and my son.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is not much.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

LAFEW  They say miracles are past, and we have our	shakespeare	swift	0

Before I speak too threat'ningly replies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Love make your fortunes twenty times above	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her that so wishes, and her humble love.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND COURT LORD	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No better, if you please.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  My wish receive,	shakespeare	swift	0
Which great Love grant, and so I take my leave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [aside]  Do all they deny her? An they were sons	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of mine, I'd have them whipped, or I would send	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [to another Lord]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be not afraid that I your hand should take.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll never do you wrong, for your own sake.	shakespeare	swift	0
Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Find fairer fortune if you ever wed.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW, [aside]  These boys are boys of ice; they'll none	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have her. Sure they are bastards to the English;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the French ne'er got 'em.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN, [to another Lord]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You are too young, too happy, and too good	shakespeare	swift	0
To make yourself a son out of my blood.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOURTH COURT LORD  Fair one, I think not so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [aside]  There's one grape yet. I am sure thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
father drunk wine. But if thou be'st not an ass, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [to Bertram]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I dare not say I take you, but I give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Me and my service ever whilst I live	shakespeare	swift	0
Into your guiding power.--This is the man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why then, young Bertram, take her. She's thy wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your Highness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In such a business give me leave to use	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The help of mine own eyes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Know'st thou not,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bertram,	shakespeare	swift	0
What she has done for me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Yes, my good lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But never hope to know why I should marry her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must answer for your raising? I know her well;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She had her breeding at my father's charge.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A poor physician's daughter my wife? Disdain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rather corrupt me ever!	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of color, weight, and heat, poured all together,	shakespeare	swift	0
Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In differences so mighty. If she be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik'st--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"A poor physician's daughter"--thou dislik'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of virtue for the name. But do not so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From lowest place whence virtuous things proceed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The place is dignified by th' doer's deed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where great additions swell 's, and virtue none,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is a dropsied honor. Good alone	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is good, without a name; vileness is so;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The property by what it is should go,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In these to nature she's immediate heir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And these breed honor. That is honor's scorn	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which challenges itself as honor's born	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And is not like the sire. Honors thrive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When rather from our acts we them derive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than our foregoers. The mere word's a slave	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Debauched on every tomb, on every grave	shakespeare	swift	0
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of honored bones indeed. What should be said?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I can create the rest. Virtue and she	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is her own dower, honor and wealth from me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
choose.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad.	shakespeare	swift	0
Let the rest go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My honor's at the stake, which to defeat	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I must produce my power.--Here, take her hand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Proud, scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That dost in vile misprision shackle up	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My love and her desert; that canst not dream	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We, poising us in her defective scale,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is in us to plant thine honor where	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Obey our will, which travails in thy good.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Believe not thy disdain, but presently	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or I will throw thee from my care forever	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Into the staggers and the careless lapse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of youth and ignorance, both my revenge and hate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Loosing upon thee in the name of justice	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Without all terms of pity. Speak. Thine answer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My fancy to your eyes. When I consider	shakespeare	swift	0
What great creation and what dole of honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The praised of the King, who, so ennobled,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is as 'twere born so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Take her by the hand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And tell her she is thine, to whom I promise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A balance more replete.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I take her hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Good fortune and the favor of the King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Smile upon this contract, whose ceremony	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And be performed tonight. The solemn feast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall more attend upon the coming space,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit. Parolles and Lafew stay behind,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
commenting of this wedding.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Your pleasure, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Your lord and master did well to make his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
recantation.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  "Recantation"? My "lord"? My "master"?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Ay. Is it not a language I speak?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  A most harsh one, and not to be understood	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
without bloody succeeding. My "master"?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Are you companion to the Count Rossillion?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  To any count, to all counts, to what is man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  To what is count's man. Count's master is of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
another style.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
too old.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
title age cannot bring thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  What I dare too well do, I dare not do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarves and the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have now found thee. When I lose thee again, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
up, and that thou 'rt scarce worth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
upon thee--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hasten thy trial, which if--Lord have mercy on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
through thee. Give me thy hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My lord, you give me most egregious	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
indignity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Ay, with all my heart, and thou art worthy of it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I have not, my lord, deserved it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it, and I will not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bate thee a scruple.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Well, I shall be wiser.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pull at a smack o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"He is a man I know."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My lord, you do me most insupportable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
vexation.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee in what motion age will give me leave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
off me. Scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
convenience, an he were double and double a lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Lafew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Sirrah, your lord and master's married. There's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
news for you: you have a new mistress.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I most unfeignedly beseech your Lordship	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Who? God?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Ay, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mine honor, if I were but two hours younger, I'd	shakespeare	swift	0
beat thee. Methink'st thou art a general offense,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  This is hard and undeserved measure, my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Go to, sir. You were beaten in Italy for picking a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
kernel out of a pomegranate. You are a vagabond,	shakespeare	swift	0
and no true traveler. You are more saucy with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lords and honorable personages than the commission	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You are not worth another word; else I'd call you	shakespeare	swift	0
knave. I leave you. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Good, very good! It is so, then. Good, very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good. Let it be concealed awhile.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Undone, and forfeited to cares forever!	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  What's the matter, sweetheart?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will not bed her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  What, what, sweetheart?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
O my Parolles, they have married me!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll to the Tuscan wars and never bed her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  There's letters from my mother. What th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
import is I know not yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
boy, to th' wars!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He wears his honor in a box unseen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Spending his manly marrow in her arms	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
France is a stable, we that dwell in 't jades.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Therefore, to th' war!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
It shall be so. I'll send her to my house,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And wherefore I am fled, write to the King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That which I durst not speak. His present gift	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where noble fellows strike. Wars is no strife	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To the dark house and the detested wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
Will this capriccio hold in thee? Art sure?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll send her straight away. Tomorrow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A young man married is a man that's marred.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Therefore away, and leave her bravely. Go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The King has done you wrong, but hush, 'tis so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Helen with a paper, and Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  She is not well, but yet she has her health. She's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
very merry, but yet she is not well. But, thanks be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
given, she's very well and wants nothing i' th' world,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but yet she is not well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  If she be very well, what does she ail that she's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not very well?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  What two things?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her quickly; the other, that she's in Earth, from	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
whence God send her quickly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Bless you, my fortunate lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
own good fortunes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  You had my prayers to lead them on, and to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
keep them on have them still.--O my knave, how	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
does my old lady?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would she did as you say.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Why, I say nothing.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have nothing is to be a great part of your title,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
which is within a very little of nothing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Away. Thou 'rt a knave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  You should have said, sir, "Before a knave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou 'rt a knave"; that's "Before me, thou 'rt a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knave." This had been truth, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Go to. Thou art a witty fool. I have found	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
taught to find me?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  ...	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and the increase of laughter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Madam, my lord will go away tonight;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A very serious business calls on him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The great prerogative and rite of love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which as your due time claims, he does acknowledge	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But puts it off to a compelled restraint,	shakespeare	swift	0
Whose want and whose delay is strewed with sweets,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which they distill now in the curbed time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And pleasure drown the brim.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  What's his will else?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
That you will take your instant leave o' th' King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Strengthened with what apology you think	shakespeare	swift	0
May make it probable need.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  What more commands he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
That, having this obtained, you presently	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Attend his further pleasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0

LAFEW  But I hope your Lordship thinks not him a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

BERTRAM  Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  You have it from his own deliverance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  And by other warranted testimony.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a bunting.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knowledge and accordingly valiant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I have then sinned against his experience and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
transgressed against his valor, and my state that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you make us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
friends. I will pursue the amity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES, [to Bertram]  These things shall be done, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PAROLLES  Sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  O, I know him well. Ay, sir, he, sir, 's a good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
workman, a very good tailor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside to Parolles]  Is she gone to the King?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  She is.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Will she away tonight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  As you'll have her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

God save you, captain.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM, [to Parolles]  Is there any unkindness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
between my lord and you, monsieur?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I know not how I have deserved to run into	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my lord's displeasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  You have made shift to run into 't, boots and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and out of it you'll run again rather than suffer	shakespeare	swift	0
question for your residence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me: there can be no kernel in this light nut. The	shakespeare	swift	0
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
matter of heavy consequence. I have kept of them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tame and know their natures.--Farewell, monsieur.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have spoken better of you than you have or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will to deserve at my hand, but we must do good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
against evil. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  An idle lord, I swear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I think not so.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Why, do you not know him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Come, come, no more of that.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  And ever shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With true observance seek to eke out that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wherein toward me my homely stars have failed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To equal my great fortune.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Let that go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Pray, sir, your pardon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Well, what would you say?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor dare I say 'tis mine--and yet it is--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What law does vouch mine own.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  What would you have?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Something, and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yes:	shakespeare	swift	0
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where are my other men?--Monsieur, farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Go thou toward home, where I will never come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Away, and for our flight.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Scene 1	shakespeare	swift	0
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, the two French	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lords, with a troop of Soldiers.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DUKE	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So that from point to point now have you heard	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fundamental reasons of this war,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And more thirsts after.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Holy seems the quarrel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon your Grace's part, black and fearful	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On the opposer.	shakespeare	swift	0
DUKE	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would in so just a business shut his bosom	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against our borrowing prayers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Good my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The reasons of our state I cannot yield	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But like a common and an outward man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That the great figure of a council frames	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By self-unable motion; therefore dare not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Say what I think of it, since I have found	shakespeare	swift	0
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As often as I guessed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DUKE  Be it his pleasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But I am sure the younger of our nation,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come here for physic.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DUKE  Welcome shall they be,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And all the honors that can fly from us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall on them settle. You know your places well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When better fall, for your avails they fell.	shakespeare	swift	0
Tomorrow to th' field.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Countess, with a paper, and Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  It hath happened all as I would have had it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
save that he comes not along with her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
melancholy man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  By what observance, I pray you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Why, he will look upon his boot and sing, mend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the ruff and sing, ask questions and sing, pick his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of	shakespeare	swift	0
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Let me see what he writes and when he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
means to come. [She opens the letter.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
old lings and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
like your old ling and your Isbels o' th' court. The	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to	shakespeare	swift	0
love as an old man loves money, with no stomach.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  What have we here?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  E'en that you have there. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS [reads.]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She hath recovered the King and undone me. I have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"not" eternal. You shall hear I am run away. Know it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
before the report come. If there be breadth enough in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you.	shakespeare	swift	0
Your unfortunate son,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bertram.	shakespeare	swift	0
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To fly the favors of so good a king,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To pluck his indignation on thy head	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For the contempt of empire.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O madam, yonder is heavy news within, between	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
two soldiers and my young lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  What is the matter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comfort. Your son will not be killed so soon as I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thought he would.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Why should he be killed?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
does. The danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of men, though it be the getting of children. Here	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
they come will tell you more. For my part, I only	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hear your son was run away. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Helen, with a paper, and two Gentlemen.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST GENTLEMAN, [to Countess]  Save you, good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Madam, my lord is gone, forever gone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN  Do not say so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Think upon patience, pray you.--Gentlemen,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That the first face of neither on the start	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We met him thitherward, for thence we came,	shakespeare	swift	0
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thither we bend again.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[She reads.] When thou canst get the ring upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my finger, which never shall come off, and show me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
call me husband. But in such a "then" I write a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"never."	shakespeare	swift	0
This is a dreadful sentence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN  Ay, madam,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But I do wash his name out of my blood,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And thou art all my child.--Towards Florence is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN  Ay, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  And to be a soldier?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Such is his noble purpose, and, believe 't,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Duke will lay upon him all the honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That good convenience claims.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Return you thither?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN [reads]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis bitter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Find you that there?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Ay, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which his heart was not consenting to.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Nothing in France until he have no wife!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's nothing here that is too good for him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But only she, and she deserves a lord	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A servant only, and a gentleman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I have sometime known.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  Parolles was it not?	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST GENTLEMAN  Ay, my good lady, he.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My son corrupts a well-derived nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With his inducement.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST GENTLEMAN  Indeed, good lady,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fellow has a deal of that too much	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which holds him much to have.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  You're welcome,	shakespeare	swift	0
gentlemen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will entreat you when you see my son	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To tell him that his sword can never win	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The honor that he loses. More I'll entreat you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Written to bear along.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND GENTLEMAN  We serve you, madam,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In that and all your worthiest affairs.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will you draw near?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[She exits with the Gentlemen.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
"Till I have no wife I have nothing in France."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nothing in France until he has no wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou shalt have none, Rossillion, none in France.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord, is 't I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That chase thee from thy country and expose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Those tender limbs of thine to the event	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of the none-sparing war? And is it I	shakespeare	swift	0
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fly with false aim; move the still-'pearing air	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whoever charges on his forward breast,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And though I kill him not, I am the cause	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His death was so effected. Better 'twere	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I met the ravin lion when he roared	shakespeare	swift	0
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That all the miseries which nature owes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rossillion,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whence honor but of danger wins a scar,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As oft it loses all. I will be gone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My being here it is that holds thee hence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The air of paradise did fan the house	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And angels officed all. I will be gone,	shakespeare	swift	0
That pitiful rumor may report my flight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

DUKE, [to Bertram]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The general of our horse thou art, and we,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon thy promising fortune.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Sir, it is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To th' extreme edge of hazard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DUKE  Then go thou forth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As thy auspicious mistress.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  This very day,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Alas! And would you take the letter of her?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Might you not know she would do as she has done	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By sending me a letter? Read it again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD [reads the letter]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ambitious love hath so in me offended	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His name with zealous fervor sanctify.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His taken labors bid him me forgive;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From courtly friends, with camping foes to live	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He is too good and fair for death and me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom I myself embrace to set him free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS	shakespeare	swift	0
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much	shakespeare	swift	0
As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I could have well diverted her intents,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which thus she hath prevented.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEWARD  Pardon me, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If I had given you this at overnight,	shakespeare	swift	0
She might have been o'erta'en. And yet she writes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Pursuit would be but vain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  What angel shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To this unworthy husband of his wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dispatch the most convenient messenger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He will return; and hope I may that she,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Led hither by pure love. Which of them both	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make distinction. Provide this messenger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[A tucket afar off. Enter old Widow of Florence, her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
daughter Diana, and Mariana, with other Citizens.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  Nay, come, for if they do approach the city, we	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shall lose all the sight.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  They say the French count has done most honorable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  It is reported that he has taken their great'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
commander, and that with his own hand he slew	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Duke's brother. [A trumpet sounds.] We have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lost our labor. They are gone a contrary way. Hark,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you may know by their trumpets.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIANA  Come, let's return again and suffice ourselves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with the report of it.--Well, Diana, take heed of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this French earl. The honor of a maid is her name,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and no legacy is so rich as honesty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW, [to Diana]  I have told my neighbor how you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have been solicited by a gentleman, his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
companion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIANA  I know that knave, hang him! One Parolles, a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
young earl.--Beware of them, Diana. Their promises,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
engines of lust are not the things they go under.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Many a maid hath been seduced by them; and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the misery is example that so terrible shows in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
succession, but that they are limed with the twigs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you further, but I hope your own grace will keep	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you where you are, though there were no further	shakespeare	swift	0
danger known but the modesty which is so lost.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  You shall not need to fear me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  I hope so.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Helen as a pilgrim.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my house; thither they send one another. I'll question	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her.--God save you, pilgrim. Whither are	shakespeare	swift	0
bound?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  To Saint Jaques le Grand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  Is this the way? [A march afar.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
Ay, marry, is 't.--Hark you, they come this way.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But till the troops come by,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The rather for I think I know your hostess	shakespeare	swift	0
As ample as myself.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  Is it yourself?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  If you shall please so, pilgrim.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
You came I think from France?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  I did so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
Here you shall see a countryman of yours	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That has done worthy service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  His name, I pray you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Count Rossillion. Know you such a one?	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN, [as pilgrim]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His face I know not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  Whatsome'er he is,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As 'tis reported, for the King had married him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against his liking. Think you it is so?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There is a gentleman that serves the Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Reports but coarsely of her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  What's his name?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Monsieur Parolles.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  O, I believe with him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In argument of praise, or to the worth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of the great count himself, she is too mean	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To have her name repeated. All her deserving	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is a reserved honesty, and that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have not heard examined.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  Alas, poor lady,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of a detesting lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A shrewd turn if she pleased.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  How do you mean?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Maybe the amorous count solicits her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In the unlawful purpose?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  He does indeed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And brokes with all that can in such a suit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Corrupt the tender honor of a maid,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But she is armed for him and keeps her guard	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In honestest defense.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIANA	shakespeare	swift	0
The gods forbid else!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Drum and Colors. Enter Bertram Count Rossillion,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Parolles, and the whole Army.]	shakespeare	swift	0
WIDOW  So, now they come.	shakespeare	swift	0
That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That, Escalus.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  Which is the Frenchman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  He,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That with the plume. 'Tis a most gallant fellow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would he loved his wife. If he were honester,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He were much goodlier. Is 't not a handsome	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gentleman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  I like him well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That leads him to these places. Were I his lady,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would poison that vile rascal.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  Which is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That jackanapes with scarves. Why is he melancholy?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Lose our drum? Well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIANA  He's shrewdly vexed at something. Look, he	shakespeare	swift	0
has spied us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW, [to Parolles]  Marry, hang you.	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIANA, [to Parolles]  And your courtesy, for a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

There's four or five, to Great Saint Jaques bound,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Already at my house.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [as pilgrim]  I humbly thank you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Please it this matron and this gentle maid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To eat with us tonight, the charge and thanking	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall be for me. And to requite you further,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Worthy the note.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion and the French	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lords, as at first.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Nay, good my lord, put him to 't. Let him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have his way.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  If your Lordship find him not a hilding,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hold me no more in your respect.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  On my life, my lord, a bubble.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Do you think I am so far deceived in him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Believe it, my lord. In mine own direct	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the owner of no one good quality worthy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your Lordship's entertainment.	shakespeare	swift	0
SECOND LORD  It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at some great and trusty business in a main danger	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fail you.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  I would I knew in what particular action to	shakespeare	swift	0
try him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  None better than to let him fetch off his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
surprise him. Such I will have whom I am sure	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversary's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when we bring him to our own tents. Be but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your Lordship present at his examination. If he do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not for the promise of his life, and in the highest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
deliver all the intelligence in his power against	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
upon oath, never trust my judgment in anything.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his drum. He says he has a stratagem for 't. When	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your Lordship sees the bottom of his success in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here he comes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  O, for the love of laughter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hinder not the honor of his design. Let him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fetch off his drum in any hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [to Parolles]  How now, monsieur? This	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drum sticks sorely in your disposition.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  A pox on 't! Let it go. 'Tis but a drum.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  But a drum! Is 't but a drum? A drum so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lost! There was excellent command, to charge in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with our horse upon our own wings and to rend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
our own soldiers!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  That was not to be blamed in the command	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the service. It was a disaster of war that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
been there to command.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some dishonor we had in the loss of that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drum, but it is not to be recovered.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  It might have been recovered.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  It might, but it is not now.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  It is to be recovered. But that the merit of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
performer, I would have that drum or another, or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hic jacet.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Why, if you have a stomach, to 't, monsieur!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring	shakespeare	swift	0
this instrument of honor again into his native	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
even to the utmost syllable of your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
worthiness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  But you must not now slumber in it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I'll about it this evening, and I will presently	shakespeare	swift	0
pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my	shakespeare	swift	0
certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and by midnight look to hear further from me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gone about it?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I know not what the success will be, my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lord, but the attempt I vow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I know thou 'rt valiant, and to the possibility	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I love not many words. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  No more than a fish loves water. Is not this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to undertake this business which he knows is not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to be done, damns himself to do, and dares better	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be damned than to do 't?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  You do not know him, my lord, as we do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
favor and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but when you find him out, you have him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ever after.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Why, do you think he will make no deed at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
all of this that so seriously he does address himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
unto?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  None in the world, but return with an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
invention and clap upon you two or three probable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lies. But we have almost embossed him. You shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lordship's respect.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  We'll make you some sport with the fox	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lord Lafew. When his disguise and he is parted,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shall see this very night.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  I must go look my twigs. He shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
caught.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Your brother he shall go along with me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  As 't please your Lordship. I'll leave you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
Now will I lead you to the house and show you	shakespeare	swift	0
The lass I spoke of.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  But you say she's honest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tokens and letters, which she did re-send.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Err in bestowing it.	shakespeare	swift	0
WIDOW  I should believe you,	shakespeare	swift	0
For you have showed me that which well approves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You're great in fortune.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN  Take this purse of gold,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Which I will overpay and pay again	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When I have found it. The Count he woos your	shakespeare	swift	0

Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now his important blood will naught deny	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That she'll demand. A ring the County wears	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That downward hath succeeded in his house	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From son to son some four or five descents	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In most rich choice. Yet, in his idle fire,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,	shakespeare	swift	0
Herself most chastely absent. After,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To what is passed already.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  I have yielded.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That time and place with this deceit so lawful	shakespeare	swift	0
May prove coherent. Every night he comes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With musics of all sorts and songs composed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

HELEN  Why then tonight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Soldiers in ambush.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORD  He can come no other way but by this hedge	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
language you will. Though you understand it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not yourselves, no matter. For we must not seem to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
understand him, unless some one among us whom	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
we must produce for an interpreter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORD  Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
voice?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  No, sir, I warrant you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORD  But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
us again?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  E'en such as you speak to me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORD  He must think us some band of strangers i' th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
adversary's entertainment. Now, he hath a smack	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of all neighboring languages. Therefore we must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what we speak one to another. So we seem to know	shakespeare	swift	0
is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gabble enough and good enough. As for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
couch, ho! Here he comes to beguile two hours in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
forges. [They move aside.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PAROLLES  Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

done? It must be a very plausive invention that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

daring the reports of my tongue.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LORD, [aside]  This is the first truth that e'er thine own	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PAROLLES  What the devil should move me to undertake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the impossibility and knowing I had no such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
purpose? I must give myself some hurts and say I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They will say "Came you off with so little?" And	shakespeare	swift	0
great ones I dare not give. Wherefore? What's the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mouth and buy myself another of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bajazeth's mule if you prattle me into these perils.	shakespeare	swift	0

Marry that will, I live and die a maid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Only, in this disguise I think 't no sin	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To cozen him that would unjustly win.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Scene 3	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter the two French Lords and some two	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
or three Soldiers.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  You have not given him his mother's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
letter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  I have delivered it an hour since. There	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is something in 't that stings his nature, for on the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reading it he changed almost into another man.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST LORD  He has much worthy blame laid upon him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Especially he hath incurred the everlasting	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
displeasure of the King, who had even tuned	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
am the grave of it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  He hath perverted a young gentlewoman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
here in Florence of a most chaste renown,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
honor. He hath given her his monumental ring and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Now God delay our rebellion! As we are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ourselves, what things are we!	shakespeare	swift	0
SECOND LORD  Merely our own traitors. And, as in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
common course of all treasons we still see them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ends, so he that in this action contrives against his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
himself.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of our unlawful intents? We shall not, then,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have his company tonight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his hour.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  That approaches apace. I would gladly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have him see his company anatomized, that he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
might take a measure of his own judgments	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  We will not meddle with him till he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
come, for his presence must be the whip of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
other.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  In the meantime, what hear you of these	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wars?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  I hear there is an overture of peace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  What will Count Rossillion do then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will he travel higher or return again into France?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  I perceive by this demand you are not altogether	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of his counsel.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
great deal of his act.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Sir, his wife some two months since fled	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Saint Jaques le Grand, which holy undertaking	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with most austere sanctimony she accomplished.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And, there residing, the tenderness of her nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  How is this justified?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  The stronger part of it by her own letters,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
which makes her story true even to the point of her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
death. Her death itself, which could not be her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the rector of the place.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Hath the Count all this intelligence?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Ay, and the particular confirmations, point	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from point, to the full arming of the verity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST LORD  How mightily sometimes we make us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comforts of our losses.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  And how mightily some other times we	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
encountered with a shame as ample.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would despair if they were not cherished by our	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
virtues.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter a Servant.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How now? Where's your master?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SERVANT  He met the Duke in the street, sir, of whom	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he hath taken a solemn leave. His Lordship will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
next morning for France. The Duke hath offered	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him letters of commendations to the King.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  They shall be no more than needful	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there, if they were more than they can commend.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Bertram Count Rossillion.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here's his Lordship now.--How now, my lord? Is 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not after midnight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a month's length apiece. By an abstract of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
success: I have congeed with the Duke, done my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my convoy, and between these main parcels	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of dispatch effected many nicer needs. The last	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  If the business be of any difficulty, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this morning your departure hence, it requires	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
haste of your Lordship.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I mean the business is not ended as fearing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
between the Fool and the Soldier? Come,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bring forth this counterfeit module; has deceived	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me like a double-meaning prophesier.	shakespeare	swift	0
SECOND LORD  Bring him forth. Has sat i' th' stocks all	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
night, poor gallant knave. [Soldiers exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  No matter. His heels have deserved it in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
himself?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  I have told your Lordship already: the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be understood: he weeps like a wench that had	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shed her milk. He hath confessed himself to Morgan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his setting i' th' stocks. And what think you he hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
confessed?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Nothing of me, has he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  His confession is taken, and it shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
read to his face. If your Lordship be in 't, as I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
believe you are, you must have the patience to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hear it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles, blindfolded, with his Interpreter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the First Soldier.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  A plague upon him! Muffled! He can say	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing of me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  Hush, hush. Hoodman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comes.--Portotartarossa.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  He calls for the tortures.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What will you say without 'em?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I will confess what I know without constraint.	shakespeare	swift	0
If you pinch me like a pasty, I can say no	shakespeare	swift	0
more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Bosko Chimurcho.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Boblibindo chicurmurco.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  You are a merciful general.--Our general	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
note.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  And truly, as I hope to live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER, [as if reading a note]  First, demand of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him how many horse the Duke is strong.--What say	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you to that?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Five or six thousand, but very weak and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and the	shakespeare	swift	0
commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and credit, and as I hope to live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Shall I set down your answer so?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Do. I'll take the Sacrament on 't, how and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
which way you will.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  All's one to him. What a past-saving	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
slave is this!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  You're deceived, my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lord. This is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
militarist--that was his own phrase--that had the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the practice in the chape of his dagger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD, [aside]  I will never trust a man again for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  Well, that's set down.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  "Five or six thousand horse," I said--I will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
say true--"or thereabouts" set down, for I'll speak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
truth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside]  He's very near the truth in this.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  But I con him no thanks for 't, in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nature he delivers it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  "Poor rogues," I pray you say.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Well, that's set down.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The rogues are marvelous poor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER, [as if reading a note]  Demand of him of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what strength they are o' foot.--What say you to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  By my troth, sir, if I were to live but this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hundred and fifty, Sebastian so many, Corambus	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
so many, Jaques so many; Guiltian, Cosmo,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lodowick and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hundred fifty each; so that the muster-file, rotten	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and sound, upon my life amounts not to fifteen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thousand poll, half of the which dare not shake the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves	shakespeare	swift	0
to pieces.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM, [aside]  What shall be done to him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside]  Nothing but let him have thanks.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[(Aside to First Soldier.)] Demand of him my condition	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and what credit I have with the Duke.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  Well, that's set down. [Pretending	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to read:] You shall demand of him whether	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one Captain Dumaine be i' th' camp, a Frenchman;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what his reputation is with the Duke, what his valor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.--What say you to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this? What do you know of it?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I beseech you let me answer to the particular	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the inter'gatories. Demand them singly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Do you know this Captain Dumaine?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I know him. He was a botcher's prentice in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shrieve's fool with child, a dumb innocent that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
could not say him nay.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside to First Lord]  Nay, by your leave, hold	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your hands, though I know his brains are forfeit to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the next tile that falls.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Well, is this captain in the Duke of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Florence's camp?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Upon my knowledge he is, and lousy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside to Bertram]  Nay, look not so upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me. We shall hear of your Lordship anon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  What is his reputation with the Duke?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  The Duke knows him for no other but a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to turn him out o' th' band. I think I have his letter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in my pocket.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER  Marry, we'll search.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They search Parolles' pockets.]	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  In good sadness, I do not know. Either it is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there, or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in my tent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  I do not know if it be it or no.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM, [aside]  Our interpreter does it well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside]  Excellently.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER [reads]  Dian, the Count's a fool and full	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of gold--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  That is not the Duke's letter, sir. That is an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rossillion, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  Nay, I'll read it first, by your favor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My meaning in 't, I protest, was very honest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in the behalf of the maid, for I knew the young	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it	shakespeare	swift	0
finds.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  Damnable both-sides rogue!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER [reads]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
take it.	shakespeare	swift	0
After he scores, he never pays the score.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Half won is match well made. Match, and well	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
make it.	shakespeare	swift	0
He ne'er pays after-debts. Take it before.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Men are to mell with; boys are not to kiss.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For count of this: the Count's a fool, I know it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Parolles.	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM, [aside]  He shall be whipped through the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
army with this rhyme in 's forehead.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD, [aside]  This is your devoted friend, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  I could endure anything before but a	shakespeare	swift	0
cat, and now he's a cat to me.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER, [to Parolles]  I perceive, sir, by our	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
general's looks we shall be fain to hang you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to die, but that, my offenses being many, I would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sir, in a dungeon, i' th' stocks, or anywhere, so I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  We'll see what may be done, so you confess	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
freely. Therefore once more to this Captain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dumaine: you have answered to his reputation	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with the Duke, and to his valor. What is his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
honesty?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister. For	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
rapes and ravishments, he parallels Nessus. He	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
professes not keeping of oaths. In breaking 'em he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
volubility that you would think truth were a fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
save to his bedclothes about him; but they know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that an honest man should not have; what an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
honest man should have, he has nothing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside]  I begin to love him for this.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  For this description of thine honesty?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A pox upon him! For me, he's more and more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a cat.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  What say you to his expertness in war?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tragedians. To belie him I will not, and more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of his soldiership I know not, except in that country	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he had the honor to be the officer at a place	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there called Mile End, to instruct for the doubling	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of files. I would do the man what honor I can, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of this I am not certain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD, [aside]  He hath out-villained villainy so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
far that the rarity redeems him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [aside]  A pox on him! He's a cat still.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  His qualities being at this poor price,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
revolt.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Sir, for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for it perpetually.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER  What's his brother, the other Captain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dumaine?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD, [aside]  Why does he ask him of me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  What's he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  E'en a crow o' th' same nest: not altogether	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
retreat he outruns any lackey. Marry, in coming on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he has the cramp.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  If your life be saved, will you undertake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to betray the Florentine?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rossillion.	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER  I'll whisper with the General and know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his pleasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES, [aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
boy the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet who	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would have suspected an ambush where I was	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
taken?	shakespeare	swift	0
FIRST SOLDIER  There is no remedy, sir, but you must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
die. The General says you that have so traitorously	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
discovered the secrets of your army and made	shakespeare	swift	0
such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
can serve the world for no honest use. Therefore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you must die.--Come, headsman, off with his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
head.	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
death!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  That shall you, and take your leave of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
all your friends. [He removes the blindfold.] So,	shakespeare	swift	0
look about you. Know you any here?	shakespeare	swift	0
BERTRAM  Good morrow, noble captain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  God bless you, Captain Parolles.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  God save you, noble captain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND LORD  Captain, what greeting will you to my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lord Lafew? I am for France.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST LORD  Good captain, will you give me a copy of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rossillion? An I were not a very coward, I'd compel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it of you. But fare you well.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Bertram and Lords exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  You are undone, captain--all but your	shakespeare	swift	0
scarf; that has a knot on 't yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Who cannot be crushed with a plot?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST SOLDIER  If you could find out a country where	shakespeare	swift	0
but women were that had received so much	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare	shakespeare	swift	0
you well, sir. I am for France too. We shall speak of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you there. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES	shakespeare	swift	0
Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As captain shall. Simply the thing I am	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That every braggart shall be found an ass.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and Parolles live	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Safest in shame. Being fooled, by fool'ry thrive.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's place and means for every man alive.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll after them. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

WIDOW  Gentle madam,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You never had a servant to whose trust	shakespeare	swift	0
Your business was more welcome.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Nor you, mistress,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As it hath fated her to be my motive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And helper to a husband. But O, strange men,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That can such sweet use make of what they hate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Defiles the pitchy night! So lust doth play	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With what it loathes for that which is away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But more of this hereafter.--You, Diana,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Something in my behalf.	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA  Let death and honesty	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Go with your impositions, I am yours	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon your will to suffer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Yet, I pray you--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But with the word "The time will bring on summer,"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All's well that ends well. Still the fine's the crown.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Scene 5	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Fool, Countess, and Lafew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  No, no, no, your son was misled with a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
snipped-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would have made all the unbaked and doughy	shakespeare	swift	0
youth of a nation in his color. Your daughter-in-law	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
had been alive at this hour, and your son here	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at home, more advanced by the King than by that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  I would I had not known him. It was the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
love.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
herb.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
salad, or rather the herb of grace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  They are not herbs, you knave. They are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nose-herbs.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir. I have not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much skill in grass.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fool?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man's.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Your distinction?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  I would cozen the man of his wife and do his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  So you were a knave at his service indeed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  At your service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  No, no, no.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
great a prince as you are.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Who's that, a Frenchman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Faith, sir, he has an English name, but his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
phys'nomy is more hotter in France than there.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  What prince is that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  The black prince, sir, alias the prince of darkness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
alias the devil.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [giving him money]  Hold thee, there's my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
master thou talk'st of. Serve him still.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his Nobility remain in 's court. I am for the house	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the	shakespeare	swift	0
broad gate and the great fire.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Go thy ways. I begin to be aweary of thee. And	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I tell thee so before because I would not fall out	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with thee. Go thy ways. Let my horses be well	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
looked to, without any tricks.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of nature. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  A shrewd knave and an unhappy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  So he is. My lord that's gone made himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much sport out of him. By his authority he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sauciness, and indeed he has no pace, but runs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
where he will.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I like him well. 'Tis not amiss. And I was about	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death	shakespeare	swift	0
and that my lord your son was upon his return	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
home, I moved the King my master to speak in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
behalf of my daughter, which in the minority of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
them both his Majesty out of a self-gracious	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
promised me to do it, and to stop up the displeasure	shakespeare	swift	0
he hath conceived against your son there is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
no fitter matter. How does your Ladyship like it?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  With very much content, my lord, and I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wish it happily effected.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
as able body as when he numbered thirty. He will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
such intelligence hath seldom failed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  It rejoices me that, I hope, I shall see him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tonight. I shall beseech your Lordship to remain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with me till they meet together.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Madam, I was thinking with what manners I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
might safely be admitted.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  You need but plead your honorable	shakespeare	swift	0
privilege.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Lady, of that I have made a bold charter. But I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thank my God it holds yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
patch of velvet on 's face. Whether there be a scar	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
under 't or no, the velvet knows, but 'tis a goodly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry	shakespeare	swift	0
of honor. So belike is that.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  But it is your carbonadoed face.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with the young noble soldier.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  'Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hats, and most courteous feathers which bow the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
head and nod at every man.	shakespeare	swift	0

Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GENTLEMAN  I have been sometimes there.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From the report that goes upon your goodness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The use of your own virtues, for the which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I shall continue thankful.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GENTLEMAN  What's your will?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN, [taking out a paper]  That it will please you	shakespeare	swift	0
To give this poor petition to the King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And aid me with that store of power you have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To come into his presence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The King's not here.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  Not here, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GENTLEMAN  Not indeed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He hence removed last night, and with more haste	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than is his use.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW  Lord, how we lose our pains!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  All's well that ends well yet,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

GENTLEMAN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Marry, as I take it, to Rossillion,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Fool and Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES, [holding out a paper]  Good Monsieur	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lavatch, give my lord Lafew this letter. I have ere	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
now, sir, been better known to you, when I have	shakespeare	swift	0
held familiarity with fresher clothes. But I am	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
now, sir, muddied in Fortune's mood, and smell	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
smell so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
eat no fish of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
allow the wind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
spake but by a metaphor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink I will stop my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nose, or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee further.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Foh! Prithee, stand away. A paper from Fortune's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
close-stool, to give to a nobleman!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Lafew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Look, here he comes himself.--Here is a purr of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat--but not a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
musk-cat--that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond	shakespeare	swift	0
of her displeasure and, as he says, is muddied	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
smiles of comfort, and leave him to your Lordship.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cruelly scratched.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
played the knave with Fortune that she should	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would not have knaves thrive long under her?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's a cardecu for you. Let the justices make	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you and Fortune friends. I am for other business.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I beseech your Honor to hear me one single	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
word.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ha 't. Save your word.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  My name, my good lord, is Parolles.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  You beg more than a word, then. Cock's my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
passion; give me your hand. How does your drum?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  O my good lord, you were the first that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
found me.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost	shakespeare	swift	0
thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
grace, for you did bring me out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at once both the office of God and the devil? One	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brings thee in grace, and the other brings thee out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Trumpets sound.] The King's coming. I know by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was made much poorer by it. But your son,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As mad in folly, lacked the sense to know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her estimation home.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
COUNTESS  'Tis past, my liege,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And I beseech your Majesty to make it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Natural rebellion done i' th' blade of youth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

I have forgiven and forgotten all,	shakespeare	swift	0
Though my revenges were high bent upon him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

LAFEW  This I must say--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But first I beg my pardon: the young lord	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Offense of mighty note, but to himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose beauty did astonish the survey	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Humbly called mistress.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Praising what is lost	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The nature of his great offense is dead,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And deeper than oblivion we do bury	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Th' incensing relics of it. Let him approach	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A stranger, no offender, and inform him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So 'tis our will he should.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Steals ere we can effect them. You remember	shakespeare	swift	0
The daughter of this lord?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Admiringly, my liege. At first	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which warped the line of every other favor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Scorned a fair color or expressed it stol'n,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Extended or contracted all proportions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To a most hideous object. Thence it came	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The dust that did offend it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Well excused.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That thou didst love her strikes some scores away	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From the great compt. But love that comes too late,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,	shakespeare	swift	0
To the great sender turns a sour offense,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now, pray you, let me see it, for mine eye,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
While I was speaking, oft was fastened to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,	shakespeare	swift	0
I bade her if her fortunes ever stood	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Necessitied to help, that by this token	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,	shakespeare	swift	0
The ring was never hers.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  Son, on my life,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At her life's rate.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I am sure I saw her wear it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
You are deceived, my lord. She never saw it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,	shakespeare	swift	0
Wrapped in a paper which contained the name	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I stood ungaged, but when I had subscribed	shakespeare	swift	0
To mine own fortune and informed her fully	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I could not answer in that course of honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As she had made the overture, she ceased	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In heavy satisfaction and would never	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Receive the ring again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Plutus himself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,	shakespeare	swift	0
Hath not in nature's mystery more science	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whoever gave it you. Then if you know	shakespeare	swift	0
That you are well acquainted with yourself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You got it from her. She called the saints to surety	shakespeare	swift	0
That she would never put it from her finger	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where you have never come, or sent it us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon her great disaster.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  She never saw it.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That thou art so inhuman--'twill not prove so,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And she is dead, which nothing but to close	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her eyes myself could win me to believe	shakespeare	swift	0
More than to see this ring.--Take him away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My forepast proofs, howe'er the matter fall,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Having vainly feared too little. Away with him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We'll sift this matter further.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  If you shall prove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where yet she never was. [He exits, under guard.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am wrapped in dismal thinkings.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter a Gentleman.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GENTLEMAN  Gracious sovereign,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He gives the King a paper.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here's a petition from a Florentine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who hath for four or five removes come short	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To tender it herself. I undertook it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of the poor suppliant, who, by this, I know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is here attending. Her business looks in her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With an importing visage, and she told me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your Highness with herself.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING [reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me. Now is the Count Rossillion a widower, his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
vows are forfeited to me and my honor's paid to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow	shakespeare	swift	0
him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In you it best lies. Otherwise a seducer flourishes,	shakespeare	swift	0
and a poor maid is undone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Diana Capilet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this. I'll none of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To bring forth this discov'ry.--Seek these suitors.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Go speedily, and bring again the Count.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Gentleman and Attendants exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was foully snatched.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  Now justice on the doers!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Bertram under guard.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet you desire to marry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Widow and Diana.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What woman's that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Derived from the ancient Capilet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My suit, as I do understand, you know	shakespeare	swift	0
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
WIDOW	shakespeare	swift	0
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And both shall cease without your remedy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come hither, count. Do you know these women?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
My lord, I neither can nor will deny	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But that I know them. Do they charge me further?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
She's none of mine, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  If you shall marry,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You give away this hand, and that is mine;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You give away myself, which is known mine,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For I by vow am so embodied yours	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That she which marries you must marry me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Either both or none.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW, [to Bertram]  Your reputation comes too short	shakespeare	swift	0
for my daughter. You are no husband for her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM, [to the King]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Highness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than for to think that I would sink it here.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than in my thought it lies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  Good my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ask him upon his oath if he does think	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He had not my virginity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What sayst thou to her?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  She's impudent, my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And was a common gamester to the camp.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He might have bought me at a common price.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose high respect and rich validity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did lack a parallel. Yet for all that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If I be one.	shakespeare	swift	0
COUNTESS  He blushes, and 'tis hit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of six preceding ancestors that gem,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Conferred by testament to th' sequent issue,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That ring's a thousand proofs.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING, [to Diana]  Methought you said	shakespeare	swift	0
You saw one here in court could witness it.	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So bad an instrument. His name's Parolles.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW	shakespeare	swift	0
I saw the man today, if man he be.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Find him, and bring him hither. [Attendant exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  What of him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With all the spots o' th' world taxed and debauched,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That will speak anything?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  She hath that ring of yours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
I think she has. Certain it is I liked her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She knew her distance and did angle for me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As all impediments in fancy's course	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are motives of more fancy; and in fine	shakespeare	swift	0
Her infinite cunning with her modern grace	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Subdued me to her rate. She got the ring,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And I had that which any inferior might	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At market price have bought.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  I must be patient.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You that have turned off a first so noble wife	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May justly diet me. I pray you yet--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Send for your ring. I will return it home,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And give me mine again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  I have it not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING, [to Diana]  What ring was yours, I pray you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sir, much like the same upon your finger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And this was it I gave him, being abed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The story, then, goes false you threw it him	shakespeare	swift	0
Out of a casement?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  I have spoke the truth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Parolles.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You boggle shrewdly. Every feather starts you.--	shakespeare	swift	0
Is this the man you speak of?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  Ay, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tell me, sirrah--but tell me true, I charge you,	shakespeare	swift	0
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off--	shakespeare	swift	0
By him and by this woman here what know you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  So please your Majesty, my master hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in him which gentlemen have.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
woman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  How, I pray you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
woman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  How is that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  He loved her, sir, and loved her not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  As thou art a knave and no knave. What an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
equivocal companion is this!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
command.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW  He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
orator.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  Do you know he promised me marriage?	shakespeare	swift	0
PAROLLES  Faith, I know more than I'll speak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PAROLLES  Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go	shakespeare	swift	0
between them, as I said; but more than that he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at that time, that I knew of their going to bed and	shakespeare	swift	0
of other motions, as promising her marriage, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
things which would derive me ill will to speak of.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Therefore I will not speak what I know.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
evidence. Therefore stand aside.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Diana.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This ring you say was yours?	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA  Ay, my good lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who lent it you?	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA  It was not lent me neither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where did you find it then?	shakespeare	swift	0
DIANA  I found it not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If it were yours by none of all these ways,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How could you give it him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  I never gave it him.	shakespeare	swift	0
LAFEW  This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
off and on at pleasure.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This ring was mine. I gave it his first wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It might be yours or hers for aught I know.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING, [to Attendants]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Take her away. I do not like her now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To prison with her, and away with him.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou diest within this hour.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  I'll never tell you.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Take her away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA  I'll put in bail, my liege.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I think thee now some common customer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA, [to Bertram]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.	shakespeare	swift	0
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Because he's guilty and he is not guilty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Great king, I am no strumpet. By my life,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am either maid or else this old man's wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She does abuse our ears. To prison with her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
DIANA	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Good mother, fetch my bail. [Widow exits.] Stay,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
royal sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And he shall surety me. But for this lord	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who hath abused me as he knows himself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And at that time he got his wife with child.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick.	shakespeare	swift	0
And now behold the meaning.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Helen and Widow.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING  Is there no exorcist	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is 't real that I see?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN  No, my good lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The name and not the thing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM  Both, both. O, pardon!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,	shakespeare	swift	0
And, look you, here's your letter. [She takes out a	shakespeare	swift	0
paper.] This it says:	shakespeare	swift	0
When from my finger you can get this ring	shakespeare	swift	0
And are by me with child, etc. This is done.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will you be mine now you are doubly won?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BERTRAM	shakespeare	swift	0
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.	shakespeare	swift	0
HELEN	shakespeare	swift	0
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Deadly divorce step between me and you.--	shakespeare	swift	0
O my dear mother, do I see you living?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
LAFEW	shakespeare	swift	0
Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Parolles.] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So, I thank thee. Wait on me home.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They are scurvy ones.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
KING	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let us from point to point this story know,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Diana.] If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For I can guess that by thy honest aid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of that and all the progress more and less,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Resolvedly more leisure shall express.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,	shakespeare	swift	0
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

The King's a beggar, now the play is done.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All is well ended if this suit be won,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MASTER  Boatswain!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  Here, master. What cheer?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MASTER  Good, speak to th' mariners. Fall to 't yarely,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir!	shakespeare	swift	0

[Enter Mariners.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my	shakespeare	swift	0

ALONSO  Good boatswain, have care. Where's the Master?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Play the men.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  I pray now, keep below.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Where is the Master, boatswain?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  Do you not hear him? You mar our labor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  Nay, good, be patient.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  When the sea is. Hence! What cares these	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Trouble us not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Good, yet remember whom thou hast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
aboard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  None that I more love than myself. You are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a councillor; if you can command these elements	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to silence, and work the peace of the present, we	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the hour, if it so hap.--Cheerly, good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hearts!--Out of our way, I say! [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he hath no drowning mark upon him. His	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

BOATSWAIN  Down with the topmast! Yare! Lower, lower!	shakespeare	swift	0
Bring her to try wi' th' main course. [(A cry	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o'er and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drown? Have you a mind to sink?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
incharitable dog!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  Work you, then.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou art.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  I'll warrant him for drowning, though the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
as an unstanched wench.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN  Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Off to sea again! Lay her off!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

GONZALO  The King and Prince at prayers. Let's assist	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

SEBASTIAN  I am out of patience.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This wide-chopped rascal--would thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Boatswain exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  He'll be hanged yet, though every drop of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
water swear against it and gape at wid'st to glut him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

SEBASTIAN  Let's take leave of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

GONZALO  Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Had I been any god of power, I would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It should the good ship so have swallowed, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fraughting souls within her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Be collected.	shakespeare	swift	0
No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's no harm done.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  O, woe the day!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  No harm.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have done nothing but in care of thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And thy no greater father.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  More to know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did never meddle with my thoughts.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  'Tis time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And pluck my magic garment from me.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Putting aside his cloak.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So,	shakespeare	swift	0
Lie there, my art.--Wipe thou thine eyes. Have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comfort.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The very virtue of compassion in thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have with such provision in mine art	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So safely ordered that there is no soul--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No, not so much perdition as an hair,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Betid to any creature in the vessel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
down,	shakespeare	swift	0
For thou must now know farther. [They sit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  You have often	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped	shakespeare	swift	0
And left me to a bootless inquisition,	shakespeare	swift	0
Concluding "Stay. Not yet."	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  The hour's now come.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A time before we came unto this cell?	shakespeare	swift	0
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out three years old.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Certainly, sir, I can.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
By what? By any other house or person?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of anything the image tell me that	shakespeare	swift	0
Hath kept with thy remembrance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  'Tis far off	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And rather like a dream than an assurance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Four or five women once that tended me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In the dark backward and abysm of time?	shakespeare	swift	0
If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How thou cam'st here thou mayst.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  But that I do not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A prince of power.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Sir, are not you my father?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And princess no worse issued.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  O, the heavens!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What foul play had we that we came from thence?	shakespeare	swift	0
Or blessed was 't we did?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Both, both, my girl.	shakespeare	swift	0
By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But blessedly holp hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  O, my heart bleeds	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To think o' th' teen that I have turned you to,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which is from my remembrance. Please you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
farther.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of all the world I loved, and to him put	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The manage of my state, as at that time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Through all the signories it was the first,	shakespeare	swift	0
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In dignity, and for the liberal arts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Without a parallel. Those being all my study,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The government I cast upon my brother	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And to my state grew stranger, being transported	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dost thou attend me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Sir, most heedfully.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Being once perfected how to grant suits,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How to deny them, who t' advance, and who	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To trash for overtopping, new created	shakespeare	swift	0
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,	shakespeare	swift	0
Or else new formed 'em, having both the key	shakespeare	swift	0
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And sucked my verdure out on 't. Thou attend'st not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
O, good sir, I do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  I pray thee, mark me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To closeness and the bettering of my mind	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With that which, but by being so retired,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Like a good parent, did beget of him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A falsehood in its contrary as great	shakespeare	swift	0
As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not only with what my revenue yielded	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But what my power might else exact, like one	shakespeare	swift	0
Who, having into truth by telling of it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Made such a sinner of his memory	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To credit his own lie, he did believe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He was indeed the Duke, out o' th' substitution	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And executing th' outward face of royalty	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dost thou hear?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
To have no screen between this part he played	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And him he played it for, he needs will be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,	shakespeare	swift	0
So dry he was for sway, wi' th' King of Naples	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The dukedom, yet unbowed--alas, poor Milan!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To most ignoble stooping.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  O, the heavens!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Mark his condition and th' event. Then tell me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If this might be a brother.	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA  I should sin	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To think but nobly of my grandmother.	shakespeare	swift	0
Good wombs have borne bad sons.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Now the condition.	shakespeare	swift	0
This King of Naples, being an enemy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premises	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Should presently extirpate me and mine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With all the honors, on my brother; whereon,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A treacherous army levied, one midnight	shakespeare	swift	0
Fated to th' purpose did Antonio open	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The gates of Milan, and i' th' dead of darkness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Me and thy crying self.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Alack, for pity!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will cry it o'er again. It is a hint	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That wrings mine eyes to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Hear a little further,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And then I'll bring thee to the present business	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which now 's upon 's, without the which this story	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were most impertinent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Wherefore did they not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That hour destroy us?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Well demanded, wench.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A mark so bloody on the business, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With colors fairer painted their foul ends.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To cry to th' sea that roared to us, to sigh	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did us but loving wrong.	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA  Alack, what trouble	shakespeare	swift	0
Was I then to you!	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  O, a cherubin	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under my burden groaned, which raised in me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
An undergoing stomach to bear up	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against what should ensue.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  How came we ashore?	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  By providence divine.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some food we had, and some fresh water, that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of his charity, who being then appointed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Master of this design, did give us, with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which since have steaded much. So, of his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gentleness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me	shakespeare	swift	0
From mine own library with volumes that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I prize above my dukedom.	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA  Would I might	shakespeare	swift	0
But ever see that man.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO, [standing]  Now I arise.	shakespeare	swift	0
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here in this island we arrived, and here	shakespeare	swift	0
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than other princes can, that have more time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
Heavens thank you for 't. And now I pray you, sir--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For still 'tis beating in my mind--your reason	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For raising this sea storm?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Know thus far forth:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I find my zenith doth depend upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A most auspicious star, whose influence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou art inclined to sleep. 'Tis a good dullness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Miranda falls asleep.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Prospero puts on his cloak.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Approach, my Ariel. Come.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ariel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To answer thy best pleasure. Be 't to fly,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ariel and all his quality.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Hast thou, spirit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  To every article.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak,	shakespeare	swift	0
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,	shakespeare	swift	0
I flamed amazement. Sometimes I'd divide	shakespeare	swift	0
And burn in many places. On the topmast,	shakespeare	swift	0
The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly,	shakespeare	swift	0
Then meet and join. Jove's lightning, the precursors	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yea, his dread trident shake.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  My brave spirit!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would not infect his reason?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Not a soul	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But felt a fever of the mad, and played	shakespeare	swift	0
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Then all afire with me. The King's son, Ferdinand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With hair up-staring--then like reeds, not hair--	shakespeare	swift	0
Was the first man that leaped; cried "Hell is empty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And all the devils are here."	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  Why, that's my spirit!	shakespeare	swift	0
But was not this nigh shore?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Close by, my master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
But are they, Ariel, safe?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Not a hair perished.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But fresher than before; and, as thou bad'st me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The King's son have I landed by himself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His arms in this sad knot. [He folds his arms.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Of the King's ship,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The mariners say how thou hast disposed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And all the rest o' th' fleet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Safely in harbor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is the King's ship. In the deep nook, where once	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou called'st me up at midnight to fetch dew	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she's hid;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The mariners all under hatches stowed,	shakespeare	swift	0
Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have left asleep. And for the rest o' th' fleet,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I dispersed, they all have met again	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And are upon the Mediterranean float,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bound sadly home for Naples,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Supposing that they saw the King's ship wracked	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And his great person perish.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Ariel, thy charge	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Exactly is performed. But there's more work.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What is the time o' th' day?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Past the mid season.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now	shakespeare	swift	0
Must by us both be spent most preciously.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which is not yet performed me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  How now? Moody?	shakespeare	swift	0
What is 't thou canst demand?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  My liberty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Before the time be out? No more.	shakespeare	swift	0
ARIEL  I prithee,	shakespeare	swift	0
Remember I have done thee worthy service,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, served	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To bate me a full year.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Dost thou forget	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From what a torment I did free thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  No.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of the salt deep,	shakespeare	swift	0
To run upon the sharp wind of the North,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To do me business in the veins o' th' Earth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When it is baked with frost.	shakespeare	swift	0
ARIEL  I do not, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  No, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
Sir, in Argier.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  O, was she so? I must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which thou forget'st. This damned witch Sycorax,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To enter human hearing, from Argier,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou know'st, was banished. For one thing she did	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They would not take her life. Is not this true?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Ay, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And here was left by th' sailors. Thou, my slave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As thou report'st thyself, was then her servant,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To act her earthy and abhorred commands,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By help of her more potent ministers	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And in her most unmitigable rage,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Into a cloven pine, within which rift	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A dozen years; within which space she died	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
(Save for the son that she did litter here,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A freckled whelp, hag-born) not honored with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A human shape.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Yes, Caliban, her son.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Could not again undo. It was mine art,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The pine and let thee out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  I thank thee, master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou hast howled away twelve winters.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Pardon, master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will be correspondent to command	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And do my spriting gently.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Do so, and after two days	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will discharge thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  That's my noble master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea. Be subject	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape,	shakespeare	swift	0
And hither come in 't. Go, hence with diligence!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Ariel exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Awake. [Miranda wakes.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  The strangeness of your story put	shakespeare	swift	0
Heaviness in me.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  Shake it off. Come on,	shakespeare	swift	0
We'll visit Caliban, my slave, who never	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yields us kind answer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA, [rising]  'Tis a villain, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I do not love to look on.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  But, as 'tis,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We cannot miss him. He does make our fire,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That profit us.--What ho, slave, Caliban!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou earth, thou, speak!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN, [within]  There's wood enough within.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Come forth, I say. There's other business for thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come, thou tortoise. When?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ariel like a water nymph.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,	shakespeare	swift	0
Hark in thine ear. [He whispers to Ariel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  My lord, it shall be done. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Caliban]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Caliban.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Drop on you both. A southwest blow on you	shakespeare	swift	0
And blister you all o'er.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Urchins	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall forth at vast of night that they may work	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than bees that made 'em.	shakespeare	swift	0
CALIBAN  I must eat my dinner.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This island's mine by Sycorax, my mother,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which thou tak'st from me. When thou cam'st first,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou strok'st me and made much of me, wouldst	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
give me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Water with berries in 't, and teach me how	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To name the bigger light and how the less,	shakespeare	swift	0
That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And showed thee all the qualities o' th' isle,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fertile.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms	shakespeare	swift	0
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you,	shakespeare	swift	0
For I am all the subjects that you have,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me	shakespeare	swift	0
The rest o' th' island.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Thou most lying slave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom stripes may move, not kindness, I have used	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Filth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The honor of my child.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
O ho, O ho! Would 't had been done!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This isle with Calibans.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Abhorred slave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hour	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With words that made them known. But thy vile	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
race,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though thou didst learn, had that in 't which good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
natures	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Deservedly confined into this rock,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
You taught me language, and my profit on 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

For learning me your language!	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  Hagseed, hence!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou 'rt best,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To answer other business. Shrugg'st thou, malice?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  No, pray thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Aside.] I must obey. His art is of such power	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And make a vassal of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  So, slave, hence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where should this music be? I' th' air, or th' earth?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some god o' th' island. Sitting on a bank,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Weeping again the King my father's wrack,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This music crept by me upon the waters,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Allaying both their fury and my passion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No, it begins again.	shakespeare	swift	0

Full fathom five thy father lies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of his bones are coral made.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Those are pearls that were his eyes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nothing of him that doth fade	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But doth suffer a sea change	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Into something rich and strange.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Burden, within:] Ding dong.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hark, now I hear them: ding dong bell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The ditty does remember my drowned father.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is no mortal business, nor no sound	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PROSPERO, [to Miranda]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

MIRANDA  What is 't? A spirit?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was in the wrack; and, but he's something stained	shakespeare	swift	0
With grief--that's beauty's canker--thou might'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
call him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And strays about to find 'em.	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA  I might call him	shakespeare	swift	0
A thing divine, for nothing natural	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I ever saw so noble.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO, [aside]  It goes on, I see,	shakespeare	swift	0
As my soul prompts it. [To Ariel.] Spirit, fine spirit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll free thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Within two days for this.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND, [seeing Miranda]  Most sure, the goddess	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On whom these airs attend!--Vouchsafe my prayer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May know if you remain upon this island,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that you will some good instruction give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How I may bear me here. My prime request,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I do last pronounce, is--O you wonder!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you be maid or no.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  No wonder, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But certainly a maid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  My language! Heavens!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am the best of them that speak this speech,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were I but where 'tis spoken.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  How? The best?	shakespeare	swift	0
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld	shakespeare	swift	0
The King my father wracked.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Alack, for mercy!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And his brave son being twain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside]  The Duke of Milan	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And his more braver daughter could control thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If now 'twere fit to do 't. At the first sight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They have changed eyes.--Delicate Ariel,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll set thee free for this. [To Ferdinand.] A word,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
Why speaks my father so ungently? This	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That e'er I sighed for. Pity move my father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To be inclined my way.	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND  O, if a virgin,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Queen of Naples.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Soft, sir, one word more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Aside.] They are both in either's powers. But this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
swift business	shakespeare	swift	0
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make the prize light. [To Ferdinand.] One word	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more. I charge thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The name thou ow'st not, and hast put thyself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon this island as a spy, to win it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From me, the lord on 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  No, as I am a man!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Good things will strive to dwell with 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]  Follow me.	shakespeare	swift	0
[To Miranda.] Speak not you for him. He's a traitor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Ferdinand.] Come,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sea water shalt thou drink. Thy food shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks	shakespeare	swift	0
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  No,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will resist such entertainment till	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mine enemy has more power.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He draws, and is charmed from moving.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  O dear father,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make not too rash a trial of him, for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's gentle and not fearful.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  What, I say,	shakespeare	swift	0
My foot my tutor?--Put thy sword up, traitor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who mak'st a show, but dar'st not strike, thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
conscience	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For I can here disarm thee with this stick	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And make thy weapon drop.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Beseech you, father--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Hence! Hang not on my garments.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Sir, have pity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll be his surety.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Silence! One word more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
An advocate for an impostor? Hush.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To th' most of men this is a Caliban,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And they to him are angels.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  My affections	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are then most humble. I have no ambition	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To see a goodlier man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]  Come on, obey.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy nerves are in their infancy again	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And have no vigor in them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  So they are.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The wrack of all my friends, nor this man's threats	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Might I but through my prison once a day	shakespeare	swift	0
Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' Earth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let liberty make use of. Space enough	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have I in such a prison.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside]  It works.--Come on.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel.--Follow me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Ariel.] Hark what thou else shalt do me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA, [to Ferdinand]  Be of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comfort.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My father's of a better nature, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which now came from him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ariel]  Thou shalt be as free	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As mountain winds; but then exactly do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All points of my command.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  To th' syllable.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Francisco, and others.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So have we all--of joy, for our escape	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The masters of some merchant, and the merchant	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I mean our preservation--few in millions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our sorrow with our comfort.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  Prithee, peace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  He receives comfort like	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cold porridge.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  The visitor will not give him o'er so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By and by it will strike.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]  Sir--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  One. Tell.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  When every grief is entertained that's offered,	shakespeare	swift	0
comes to th' entertainer--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A dollar.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
truer than you purposed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you	shakespeare	swift	0
should.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]  Therefore, my lord--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO, [to Gonzalo]  I prithee, spare.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  Well, I have done. But yet--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [aside to Antonio]  He will be talking.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO, [aside to Sebastian]  Which, of he or Adrian,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for a good wager, first begins to crow?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  The old cock.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  The cockerel.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Done. The wager?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  A laughter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A match!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  Though this island seem to be desert--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Ha, ha, ha.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  So. You're paid.	shakespeare	swift	0
ADRIAN  Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible--	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  Yet--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  Yet--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  He could not miss 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
temperance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Temperance was a delicate wench.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
delivered.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Here is everything advantageous to life.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  True, save means to live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Of that there's none, or little.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  How lush and lusty the grass looks! How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
green!	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  The ground indeed is tawny.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  With an eye of green in 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  He misses not much.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beyond credit--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  As many vouched rarities are.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  That our garments, being, as they were,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
freshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stained with salt water.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  If but one of his pockets could speak, would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it not say he lies?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Methinks our garments are now as fresh as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage	shakespeare	swift	0
of the King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tunis.	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
well in our return.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  Tunis was never graced before with such a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
paragon to their queen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Not since widow Dido's time.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Widow? A pox o' that! How came that "widow"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in? Widow Dido!	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  What if he had said "widower Aeneas" too?	shakespeare	swift	0
Good Lord, how you take it!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN, [to Gonzalo]  "Widow Dido," said you? You	shakespeare	swift	0
make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tunis.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  Carthage?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  I assure you, Carthage.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  His word is more than the miraculous harp.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  He hath raised the wall, and houses too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  What impossible matter will he make easy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
next?	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  I think he will carry this island home in his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pocket and give it his son for an apple.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
forth more islands.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Ay.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Why, in good time.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]  Sir, we were talking that our	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
garments seem now as fresh as when we were at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
queen.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  And the rarest that e'er came there.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]  Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  That "sort" was well fished for.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]  When I wore it at your daughter's	shakespeare	swift	0
marriage.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
You cram these words into mine ears against	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never	shakespeare	swift	0
Married my daughter there, for coming thence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who is so far from Italy removed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I ne'er again shall see her.--O, thou mine heir	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath made his meal on thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FRANCISCO  Sir, he may live.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I saw him beat the surges under him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The surge most swoll'n that met him. His bold head	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To th' shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bowed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He came alive to land.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  No, no, he's gone.	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But rather lose her to an African,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where she at least is banished from your eye,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who hath cause to wet the grief on 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  Prithee, peace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise	shakespeare	swift	0
By all of us; and the fair soul herself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Weighed between loathness and obedience at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your son,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
More widows in them of this business' making	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than we bring men to comfort them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The fault's your own.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  So is the dear'st o' th' loss.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  My lord Sebastian,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And time to speak it in. You rub the sore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When you should bring the plaster.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Very well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  And most chirurgeonly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When you are cloudy.	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  Foul weather?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Very foul.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He'd sow 't with nettle seed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Or docks, or mallows.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
And were the king on 't, what would I do?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Scape being drunk, for want of wine.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Execute all things, for no kind of traffic	shakespeare	swift	0
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;	shakespeare	swift	0
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And use of service, none; contract, succession,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No occupation; all men idle, all,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And women too, but innocent and pure;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No sovereignty--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Yet he would be king on 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  The latter end of his commonwealth forgets	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the beginning.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
All things in common nature should produce	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of its own kind all foison, all abundance,	shakespeare	swift	0
To feed my innocent people.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  No marrying 'mong his subjects?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

I would with such perfection govern, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
T' excel the Golden Age.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  'Save his Majesty!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Long live Gonzalo!	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  And do you mark me, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  I do well believe your Highness, and did it to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to laugh at nothing.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  'Twas you we laughed at.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Who in this kind of merry fooling am	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing still.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  What a blow was there given!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  An it had not fallen flatlong.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
continue in it five weeks without changing.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Ariel invisible, playing solemn music.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  We would so, and then go a-batfowling.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO, [to Gonzalo]  Nay, good my lord, be not angry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?	shakespeare	swift	0
For I am very heavy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Go sleep, and hear us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[All sink down asleep except Alonso,	shakespeare	swift	0
Antonio, and Sebastian.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes	shakespeare	swift	0
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They are inclined to do so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Please you, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not omit the heavy offer of it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is a comforter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  We two, my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will guard your person while you take your rest,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And watch your safety.	shakespeare	swift	0
ALONSO  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Alonso sleeps. Ariel exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is the quality o' th' climate.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Why	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not myself disposed to sleep.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Nor I. My spirits are nimble.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They fell together all, as by consent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Worthy Sebastian, O, what might--? No more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet methinks I see it in thy face	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What thou shouldst be. Th' occasion speaks thee, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My strong imagination sees a crown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dropping upon thy head.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  What, art thou waking?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do you not hear me speak?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  I do, and surely	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is a strange repose, to be asleep	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With eyes wide open--standing, speaking, moving--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet so fast asleep.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  Noble Sebastian,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink'st	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whiles thou art waking.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Thou dost snore distinctly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's meaning in thy snores.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am more serious than my custom. You	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Trebles thee o'er.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Well, I am standing water.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll teach you how to flow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Do so. To ebb	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hereditary sloth instructs me.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  O,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish	shakespeare	swift	0
Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Most often do so near the bottom run	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By their own fear or sloth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Prithee, say on.	shakespeare	swift	0
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which throes thee much to yield.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Thus, sir:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Although this lord of weak remembrance--this,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who shall be of as little memory	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When he is earthed--hath here almost persuaded--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Professes to persuade--the King his son's alive,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis as impossible that he's undrowned	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As he that sleeps here swims.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  I have no hope	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That he's undrowned.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  O, out of that no hope	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What great hope have you! No hope that way is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Another way so high a hope that even	shakespeare	swift	0
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That Ferdinand is drowned?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  He's gone.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  Then tell me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who's the next heir of Naples?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Claribel.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The man i' th' moon's too slow--till newborn chins	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be rough and razorable; she that from whom	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again,	shakespeare	swift	0
And by that destiny to perform an act	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In yours and my discharge.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  What stuff is this? How say you?	shakespeare	swift	0
'Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So is she heir of Naples, 'twixt which regions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There is some space.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  A space whose ev'ry cubit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Seems to cry out "How shall that Claribel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis	shakespeare	swift	0
And let Sebastian wake." Say this were death	shakespeare	swift	0
That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As amply and unnecessarily	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As this Gonzalo. I myself could make	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The mind that I do, what a sleep were this	shakespeare	swift	0
For your advancement! Do you understand me?	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Methinks I do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  And how does your content	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tender your own good fortune?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  I remember	shakespeare	swift	0
You did supplant your brother Prospero.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  True,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And look how well my garments sit upon me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Much feater than before. My brother's servants	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  But, for your conscience?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ay, sir, where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not	shakespeare	swift	0
This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No better than the earth he lies upon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If he were that which now he's like--that's dead--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To the perpetual wink for aye might put	shakespeare	swift	0
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They'll tell the clock to any business that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We say befits the hour.	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  Thy case, dear friend,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall be my precedent: as thou got'st Milan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And I the King shall love thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Draw together,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And when I rear my hand, do you the like	shakespeare	swift	0
To fall it on Gonzalo. [They draw their swords.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  O, but one word.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They talk apart.]	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Ariel, invisible, with music and song.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [to the sleeping Gonzalo]	shakespeare	swift	0
My master through his art foresees the danger	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For else his project dies--to keep them living.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Sings in Gonzalo's ear:]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
While you here do snoring lie,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Open-eyed conspiracy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His time doth take.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If of life you keep a care,	shakespeare	swift	0
Shake off slumber and beware.	shakespeare	swift	0
Awake, awake!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO, [to Sebastian]  Then let us both be sudden.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [waking]  Now, good angels preserve the	shakespeare	swift	0
King! [He wakes Alonso.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO, [to Sebastian]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wherefore this ghastly looking?	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO, [to Sebastian]  What's the matter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,	shakespeare	swift	0
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing	shakespeare	swift	0
Like bulls, or rather lions. Did 't not wake you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It struck mine ear most terribly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  I heard nothing.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of a whole herd of lions.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  Heard you this, Gonzalo?	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that a strange one too, which did awake me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or that we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
Lead off this ground, and let's make further search	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For my poor son.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Heavens keep him from these beasts,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For he is, sure, i' th' island.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  Lead away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Scene 2	shakespeare	swift	0
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thunder heard.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
All the infections that the sun sucks up	shakespeare	swift	0
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em. But	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For every trifle are they set upon me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me	shakespeare	swift	0
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Perchance he will not mind me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Trinculo.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I	shakespeare	swift	0
hear it sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud	shakespeare	swift	0
cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. [Noticing Caliban.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
alive? A fish, he smells like a fish--a very ancient	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday	shakespeare	swift	0
fool there but would give a piece of silver. There	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would this monster make a man. Any strange beast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like	shakespeare	swift	0
arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now let loose my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Thunder.] Alas, the storm is come again. My best	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dregs of the storm be past.	shakespeare	swift	0
[He crawls under Caliban's cloak.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Stephano singing.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I shall no more to sea, to sea.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here shall I die ashore--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Well, here's my comfort. [Drinks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Sings.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The gunner and his mate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,	shakespeare	swift	0
But none of us cared for Kate.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For she had a tongue with a tang,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would cry to a sailor "Go hang!"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is a scurvy tune too. But here's my comfort.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Drinks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Do not torment me! O!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now	shakespeare	swift	0
of your four legs, for it hath been said "As proper a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man as ever went on four legs cannot make him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
give ground," and it shall be said so again while	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Stephano breathes at' nostrils.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  The spirit torments me. O!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  This is some monster of the isle with four	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
devil should he learn our language? I will give him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
neat's leather.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Do not torment me, prithee. I'll bring my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wood home faster.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  He's in his fit now, and does not talk after	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove	shakespeare	swift	0
his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hath him, and that soundly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
works upon thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Come on your ways. Open your mouth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here is that which will give language to you, cat.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I	shakespeare	swift	0
can tell you, and that soundly. [Caliban drinks.] You	shakespeare	swift	0
cannot tell who's your friend. Open your chaps	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
again.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  I should know that voice. It should be--but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Four legs and two voices--a most delicate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle	shakespeare	swift	0
will recover him, I will help his ague. Come.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Caliban drinks.] Amen! I will pour some in thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
other mouth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Stephano!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have no long spoon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Stephano! If thou be'st Stephano, touch me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and speak to me, for I am Trinculo--be not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
afeard--thy good friend Trinculo.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  If thou be'st Trinculo, come forth. I'll pull	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo's legs,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
these are they. [He pulls him out from under Caliban's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cloak.] Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cam'st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he vent Trinculos?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf's	shakespeare	swift	0
gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is not constant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN, [aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sprites. That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will kneel to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He crawls out from under the cloak.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  How didst thou scape? How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cam'st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cam'st hither--I escaped upon a butt of sack, which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the sailors heaved o'erboard--by this bottle, which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
since I was cast ashore.	shakespeare	swift	0
CALIBAN  I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
subject, for the liquor is not earthly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  Here. Swear then how thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
escapedst.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim	shakespeare	swift	0
like a duck, I'll be sworn.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  Here, kiss the book. [Trinculo drinks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
like a goose.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  O Stephano, hast any more of this?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
by th' seaside, where my wine is hid.--How now,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mooncalf, how does thine ague?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Hast thou not dropped from heaven?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee. I was the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man i' th' moon when time was.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bush.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Caliban drinks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  By this good light, this is a very shallow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man i' th' moon? A most poor, credulous monster!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
--Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  By this light, a most perfidious and drunken	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster. When 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  I'll kiss thy foot. I'll swear myself thy subject.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Come on, then. Down, and swear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Caliban kneels.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster. A most scurvy monster. I could	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
find in my heart to beat him--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Come, kiss.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  --but that the poor monster's in drink. An	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
abominable monster.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll show thee the best springs. I'll pluck thee berries.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou wondrous man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of a poor drunkard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

To snare the nimble marmoset. I'll bring thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  I prithee now, lead the way without any	shakespeare	swift	0

[Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There be some sports are painful, and their labor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Point to rich ends. This my mean task	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And makes my labors pleasures. O, she is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
baseness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Had never like executor. I forget;	shakespeare	swift	0
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Most busiest when I do it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Miranda; and Prospero at a distance, unobserved.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Alas now, pray you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Work not so hard. I would the lightning had	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile.	shakespeare	swift	0
Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns	shakespeare	swift	0
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's safe for these three hours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  O most dear mistress,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The sun will set before I shall discharge	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What I must strive to do.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  If you'll sit down,	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray, give me that.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll carry it to the pile.	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND  No, precious creature,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,	shakespeare	swift	0
Than you should such dishonor undergo	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
While I sit lazy by.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  It would become me	shakespeare	swift	0
As well as it does you, and I should do it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yours it is against.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This visitation shows it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  You look wearily.	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No, noble mistress, 'tis fresh morning with me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When you are by at night. I do beseech you,	shakespeare	swift	0
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,	shakespeare	swift	0
What is your name?	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA  Miranda.--O my father,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have broke your hest to say so!	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND  Admired Miranda!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Indeed the top of admiration, worth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have I liked several women, never any	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With so full soul but some defect in her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And put it to the foil. But you, O you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So perfect and so peerless, are created	shakespeare	swift	0
Of every creature's best.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  I do not know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One of my sex, no woman's face remember,	shakespeare	swift	0
Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
More that I may call men than you, good friend,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And my dear father. How features are abroad	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am skilless of, but by my modesty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Any companion in the world but you,	shakespeare	swift	0
Nor can imagination form a shape	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Besides yourself to like of. But I prattle	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I therein do forget.	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND  I am in my condition	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A prince, Miranda; I do think a king--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would, not so!--and would no more endure	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This wooden slavery than to suffer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The very instant that I saw you did	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My heart fly to your service, there resides	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make me slave to it, and for your sake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Am I this patient log-man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Do you love me?	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O heaven, O Earth, bear witness to this sound,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And crown what I profess with kind event	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If I speak true; if hollowly, invert	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What best is boded me to mischief. I,	shakespeare	swift	0
Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do love, prize, honor you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  I am a fool	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To weep at what I am glad of.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside]  Fair encounter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of two most rare affections. Heavens rain grace	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On that which breeds between 'em!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  Wherefore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
weep you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What I desire to give, and much less take	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am your wife if you will marry me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You may deny me, but I'll be your servant	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whether you will or no.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
My husband, then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  Ay, with a heart as willing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As bondage e'er of freedom. Here's my hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA, [clasping his hand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And mine, with my heart in 't. And now farewell	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till half an hour hence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  A thousand thousand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
So glad of this as they I cannot be,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For yet ere suppertime must I perform	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Much business appertaining.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  Tell not me. When the butt is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
out, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bear up and board 'em.--Servant monster,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drink to me.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  Servant monster? The folly of this island!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They say there's but five upon this isle; we are three	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of them. If th' other two be brained like us, the state	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
totters.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Caliban drinks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Where should they be set else? He were a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  My man-monster hath drowned his tongue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty	shakespeare	swift	0
leagues off and on, by this light.--Thou shalt be my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lieutenant, monster, or my standard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Your lieutenant, if you list. He's no	shakespeare	swift	0
standard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Nor go neither. But you'll lie like dogs, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yet say nothing neither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be'st a good mooncalf.	shakespeare	swift	0
CALIBAN  How does thy Honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not serve him; he is not valiant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lord?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  "Lord," quoth he? That a monster should be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
such a natural!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
indignity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to harken once again to the suit I made to thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stand, and so shall Trinculo.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ariel, invisible.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN, [kneeling]  As I told thee before, I am subject	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cheated me of the island.	shakespeare	swift	0
ARIEL, [in Trinculo's voice]  Thou liest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN, [to Trinculo]  Thou liest, thou jesting monkey,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou. [He stands.] I would my valiant master would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
destroy thee. I do not lie.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in 's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
teeth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Why, I said nothing.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  Mum then, and no more. [Trinculo stands	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
aside.] Proceed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
I say by sorcery he got this isle;	shakespeare	swift	0
From me he got it. If thy Greatness will,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Revenge it on him, for I know thou dar'st,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But this thing dare not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  That's most certain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  How now shall this be compassed? Canst	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou bring me to the party?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Yea, yea, my lord. I'll yield him thee asleep,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [in Trinculo's voice]  Thou liest. Thou canst not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
What a pied ninny's this!--Thou scurvy patch!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And take his bottle from him. When that's gone,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He shall drink naught but brine, for I'll not show him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where the quick freshes are.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the monster one word further, and by this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stockfish of thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go	shakespeare	swift	0
farther off.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  Didst thou not say he lied?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [in Trinculo's voice]  Thou liest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Do I so? Take thou that. [He beats Trinculo.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As you like this, give me the lie another time.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  I did not give the lie! Out o' your wits and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! This can sack and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the	shakespeare	swift	0
devil take your fingers!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Ha, ha, ha!	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  Now forward with your tale. [To Trinculo.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prithee, stand further off.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Beat him enough. After a little time	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll beat him too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Stand farther. [Trinculo moves farther	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
away.] Come, proceed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I' th' afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Having first seized his books, or with a log	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
First to possess his books, for without them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One spirit to command. They all do hate him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He has brave utensils--for so he calls them--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And that most deeply to consider is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The beauty of his daughter. He himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But only Sycorax my dam and she;	shakespeare	swift	0
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As great'st does least.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Is it so brave a lass?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And bring thee forth brave brood.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and I will be king and queen--save our Graces!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.--Dost	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou like the plot, Trinculo?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Excellent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
head.	shakespeare	swift	0
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Within this half hour will he be asleep.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wilt thou destroy him then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Ay, on mine honor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [aside]  This will I tell my master.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou mak'st me merry. I am full of pleasure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You taught me but whilere?	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  At thy request, monster, I will do reason,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
any reason.--Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Sings.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Flout 'em and cout 'em	shakespeare	swift	0
And scout 'em and flout 'em!	shakespeare	swift	0
Thought is free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  That's not the tune.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  What is this same?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  This is the tune of our catch played by the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
picture of Nobody.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO, [to the invisible musician]  If thou be'st a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be'st a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
devil, take 't as thou list.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  O, forgive me my sins!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  He that dies pays all debts.--I defy thee!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mercy upon us!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  Art thou afeard?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  No, monster, not I.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,	shakespeare	swift	0
Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The clouds methought would open, and show riches	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I cried to dream again.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  This will prove a brave kingdom to me,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
where I shall have my music for nothing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  When Prospero is destroyed.	shakespeare	swift	0
STEPHANO  That shall be by and by. I remember the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
story.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  The sound is going away. Let's follow it, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
after do our work.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Lead, monster. We'll follow.--I would I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
could see this taborer. He lays it on. Wilt come?	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  I'll follow, Stephano.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
move toward the table.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel, like a Harpy, claps	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his wings upon the table, and with a quaint device the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
banquet vanishes.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL [as Harpy]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That hath to instrument this lower world	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And what is in 't, the never-surfeited sea	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where man doth not inhabit, you 'mongst men	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And even with such-like valor, men hang and drown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their proper selves.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio draw their swords.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You fools, I and my fellows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are ministers of Fate. The elements	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of whom your swords are tempered may as well	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Wound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Kill the still-closing waters as diminish	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One dowl that's in my plume. My fellow ministers	shakespeare	swift	0
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,	shakespeare	swift	0
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths	shakespeare	swift	0
And will not be uplifted. But remember--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For that's my business to you--that you three	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From Milan did supplant good Prospero,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Him and his innocent child, for which foul deed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The powers--delaying, not forgetting--have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ling'ring perdition, worse than any death	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can be at once, shall step by step attend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart's sorrow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And a clear life ensuing. [He vanishes in thunder.]	shakespeare	swift	0
[Then, to soft music, enter the shapes again, and dance,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.]	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Performed, my Ariel. A grace it had, devouring.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In what thou hadst to say. So, with good life	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And observation strange, my meaner ministers	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their several kinds have done. My high charms	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
work,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And these mine enemies are all knit up	shakespeare	swift	0
In their distractions. They now are in my power;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And in these fits I leave them while I visit	shakespeare	swift	0
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And his and mine loved darling. [He exits, above.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO, [to Alonso]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I' th' name of something holy, sir, why stand you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In this strange stare?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  O, it is monstrous, monstrous!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.	shakespeare	swift	0
Therefor my son i' th' ooze is bedded, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And with him there lie mudded. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  But one fiend at a time,	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll fight their legions o'er.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  I'll be thy second.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Like poison given to work a great time after,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And hinder them from what this ecstasy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May now provoke them to.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ADRIAN  Follow, I pray you.	shakespeare	swift	0

[Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If I have too austerely punished you,	shakespeare	swift	0
Your compensation makes amends, for I	shakespeare	swift	0
Have given you here a third of mine own life,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or that for which I live; who once again	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hast strangely stood the test. Here afore heaven	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not smile at me that I boast of her,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And make it halt behind her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  I do believe it	shakespeare	swift	0
Against an oracle.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All sanctimonious ceremonies may	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With full and holy rite be ministered,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  As I hope	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our worser genius can shall never melt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mine honor into lust to take away	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The edge of that day's celebration	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When I shall think or Phoebus' steeds are foundered	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or night kept chained below.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Fairly spoke.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sit then and talk with her. She is thine own.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Ferdinand and Miranda move aside.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What, Ariel, my industrious servant, Ariel!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ariel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
What would my potent master? Here I am.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did worthily perform, and I must use you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Incite them to quick motion, for I must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And they expect it from me.	shakespeare	swift	0
ARIEL  Presently?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Ay, with a twink.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
Before you can say "Come" and "Go,"	shakespeare	swift	0
And breathe twice, and cry "So, so,"	shakespeare	swift	0
Each one, tripping on his toe,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will be here with mop and mow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do you love me, master? No?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till thou dost hear me call.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Well; I conceive.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To th' fire i' th' blood. Be more abstemious,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or else goodnight your vow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  I warrant you, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Abates the ardor of my liver.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Well.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now come, my Ariel. Bring a corollary	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Soft music.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No tongue. All eyes. Be silent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Iris.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
IRIS	shakespeare	swift	0
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
broom groves,	shakespeare	swift	0
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Being lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where thou thyself dost air--the Queen o' th' sky,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose wat'ry arch and messenger am I,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ceres.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CERES	shakespeare	swift	0
Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne'er	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;	shakespeare	swift	0
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,	shakespeare	swift	0
Rich scarf to my proud Earth. Why hath thy queen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
IRIS	shakespeare	swift	0
A contract of true love to celebrate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And some donation freely to estate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On the blest lovers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CERES  Tell me, heavenly bow,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her and her blind boy's scandaled company	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have forsworn.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
IRIS  Of her society	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be not afraid. I met her deity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
done	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till Hymen's torch be lighted--but in vain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mars's hot minion is returned again;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Swears he will shoot no more, but play with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sparrows,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And be a boy right out.	shakespeare	swift	0

Earth's increase, foison plenty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Barns and garners never empty,	shakespeare	swift	0
Vines with clust'ring bunches growing,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Plants with goodly burden bowing;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Spring come to you at the farthest	shakespeare	swift	0
In the very end of harvest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Scarcity and want shall shun you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ceres' blessing so is on you.	shakespeare	swift	0
FERDINAND	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is a most majestic vision, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To think these spirits?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Spirits, which by mine art	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have from their confines called to enact	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My present fancies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  Let me live here ever.	shakespeare	swift	0
So rare a wondered father and a wise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Makes this place paradise.	shakespeare	swift	0

Leave your crisp channels and on this green land	shakespeare	swift	0
Answer your summons, Juno does command.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A contract of true love. Be not too late.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter certain Nymphs.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come hither from the furrow and be merry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In country footing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
I had forgot that foul conspiracy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Is almost come.--Well done. Avoid. No more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To a strange, hollow, and confused noise,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the spirits heavily vanish.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND, [to Miranda]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is strange. Your father's in some passion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That works him strongly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA  Never till this day	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As I foretold you, were all spirits and	shakespeare	swift	0
Are melted into air, into thin air;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And like the baseless fabric of this vision,	shakespeare	swift	0
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,	shakespeare	swift	0
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,	shakespeare	swift	0
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As dreams are made on, and our little life	shakespeare	swift	0
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you be pleased, retire into my cell	shakespeare	swift	0
And there repose. A turn or two I'll walk	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

We must prepare to meet with Caliban.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lest I might anger thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So full of valor that they smote the air	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For breathing in their faces, beat the ground	shakespeare	swift	0
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending	shakespeare	swift	0
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ears,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That, calf-like, they my lowing followed through	shakespeare	swift	0
Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thorns,	shakespeare	swift	0
Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O'erstunk their feet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  This was well done, my bird.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy shape invisible retain thou still.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For stale to catch these thieves.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  I go, I go. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,	shakespeare	swift	0
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;	shakespeare	swift	0

CALIBAN  Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

STEPHANO  Monster, your fairy, which you say is a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
harmless fairy, has done little better than played the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
jack with us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my nose is in great indignation.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  So is mine.--Do you hear, monster. If I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
should take a displeasure against you, look you--	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  Thou wert but a lost monster.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
softly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All's hushed as midnight yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  There is not only disgrace and dishonor in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that, monster, but an infinite loss.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  That's more to me than my wetting. Yet this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is your harmless fairy, monster!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ears for my labor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is the mouth o' th' cell. No noise, and enter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do that good mischief which may make this island	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For aye thy foot-licker.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thoughts.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO, [seeing the apparel]  O King Stephano, O	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
here is for thee!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Let it alone, thou fool. It is but trash.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a	shakespeare	swift	0
frippery. [He puts on one of the gowns.] O King	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Stephano!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll have that gown.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Thy Grace shall have it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To dote thus on such luggage? Let 't alone,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And do the murder first. If he awake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Make us strange stuff.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Be you quiet, monster.--Mistress Line, is	shakespeare	swift	0
not this my jerkin? [He takes a jacket from the tree.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now is the jerkin under the line.--Now, jerkin, you	shakespeare	swift	0
are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.	shakespeare	swift	0
TRINCULO  Do, do. We steal by line and level, an 't like	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your Grace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  I thank thee for that jest. Here's a garment	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for 't. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

pass of pate. There's another garment for 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  Monster, come, put some lime upon your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0

With foreheads villainous low.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Follow and do me service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ACT 5	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=====	shakespeare	swift	0
Scene 1	shakespeare	swift	0
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Now does my project gather to a head.	shakespeare	swift	0
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Goes upright with his carriage.--How's the day?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You said our work should cease.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  I did say so	shakespeare	swift	0
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,	shakespeare	swift	0
How fares the King and 's followers?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  Confined	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
together	shakespeare	swift	0
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
They cannot budge till your release. The King,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His brother, and yours abide all three distracted,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And the remainder mourning over them,	shakespeare	swift	0
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Gonzalo.	shakespeare	swift	0
His tears runs down his beard like winter's drops	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'em	shakespeare	swift	0
That if you now beheld them, your affections	shakespeare	swift	0
Would become tender.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Dost thou think so, spirit?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
Mine would, sir, were I human.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  And mine shall.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
quick,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do I take part. The rarer action is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And they shall be themselves.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL  I'll fetch them, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
You elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,	shakespeare	swift	0
And you that on the sands with printless foot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that	shakespeare	swift	0
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Weak masters though you be, I have bedimmed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up	shakespeare	swift	0
The pine and cedar; graves at my command	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By my so potent art. But this rough magic	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I here abjure, and when I have required	shakespeare	swift	0
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Prospero gestures with his staff.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To work mine end upon their senses that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And deeper than did ever plummet sound	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll drown my book. [Solemn music.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso with a frantic	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
like manner attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A solemn air, and the best comforter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now useless, boiled within thy skull. There stand,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For you are spell-stopped.--	shakespeare	swift	0
Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mine eyes, e'en sociable to the show of thine,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fall fellowly drops.--The charm dissolves apace,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And as the morning steals upon the night,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their clearer reason.--O good Gonzalo,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My true preserver and a loyal sir	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To him thou follow'st, I will pay thy graces	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Home, both in word and deed.--Most cruelly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou art pinched for 't now, Sebastian.--Flesh and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
blood,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You, brother mine, that entertained ambition,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Expelled remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Would here have killed your king, I do forgive thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unnatural though thou art.--Their understanding	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That yet looks on me or would know me.--Ariel,	shakespeare	swift	0
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Ariel exits and at once returns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with Prospero's ducal robes.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will discase me and myself present	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As I was sometime Milan.--Quickly, spirit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou shalt ere long be free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL [sings, and helps to attire him.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where the bee sucks, there suck I.	shakespeare	swift	0
In a cowslip's bell I lie.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There I couch when owls do cry.	shakespeare	swift	0
On the bat's back I do fly	shakespeare	swift	0
After summer merrily.	shakespeare	swift	0
Merrily, merrily shall I live now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under the blossom that hangs on the bow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, that's my dainty Ariel. I shall miss	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thee, but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To the King's ship, invisible as thou art.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Being awake, enforce them to this place,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And presently, I prithee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL	shakespeare	swift	0
I drink the air before me, and return	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or ere your pulse twice beat. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement	shakespeare	swift	0
Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of this fearful country!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Alonso]  Behold, sir king,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For more assurance that a living prince	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He embraces Alonso.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And to thee and thy company I bid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A hearty welcome.	shakespeare	swift	0
ALONSO  Whe'er thou be'st he or no,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
(As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I fear a madness held me. This must crave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
An if this be at all, a most strange story.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prospero	shakespeare	swift	0
Be living and be here?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [to Gonzalo]  First, noble friend,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be measured or confined.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Whether this be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or be not, I'll not swear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  You do yet taste	shakespeare	swift	0
Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.] But you, my brace	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of lords, were I so minded,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And justify you traitors. At this time	shakespeare	swift	0
I will tell no tales.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [aside]  The devil speaks in him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside to Sebastian]  No.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Antonio.] For you, most wicked sir, whom to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
call brother	shakespeare	swift	0
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou must restore.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  If thou be'st Prospero,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Give us particulars of thy preservation,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My dear son Ferdinand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  I am woe for 't, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
Irreparable is the loss, and patience	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Says it is past her cure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  I rather think	shakespeare	swift	0
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For the like loss, I have her sovereign aid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And rest myself content.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  You the like loss?	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
As great to me as late, and supportable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than you may call to comfort you, for I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have lost my daughter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  A daughter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish	shakespeare	swift	0
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where my son lies!--When did you lose your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
daughter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At this encounter do so much admire	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That they devour their reason, and scarce think	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are natural breath.--But howsoe'er you have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Been justled from your senses, know for certain	shakespeare	swift	0
That I am Prospero and that very duke	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
strangely	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon this shore, where you were wracked, was	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
landed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To be the lord on 't. No more yet of this.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not a relation for a breakfast, nor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Befitting this first meeting. [To Alonso.] Welcome, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This cell's my court. Here have I few attendants,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My dukedom since you have given me again,	shakespeare	swift	0
I will requite you with as good a thing,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
At least bring forth a wonder to content you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As much as me my dukedom.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
playing at chess.]	shakespeare	swift	0
MIRANDA, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Sweet lord, you play me false.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  No, my dearest love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would not for the world.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA	shakespeare	swift	0
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And I would call it fair play.	shakespeare	swift	0
ALONSO  If this prove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A vision of the island, one dear son	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall I twice lose.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A most high miracle!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND, [seeing Alonso and coming forward]	shakespeare	swift	0
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have cursed them without cause. [He kneels.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  Now, all the	shakespeare	swift	0
blessings	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of a glad father compass thee about!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Ferdinand stands.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MIRANDA, [rising and coming forward]  O wonder!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How many goodly creatures are there here!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That has such people in 't!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  'Tis new to thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO, [to Ferdinand]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is she the goddess that hath severed us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And brought us thus together?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FERDINAND  Sir, she is mortal,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But by immortal providence she's mine.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I chose her when I could not ask my father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of whom so often I have heard renown,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But never saw before, of whom I have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Received a second life; and second father	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This lady makes him to me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  I am hers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must ask my child forgiveness!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  There, sir, stop.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let us not burden our remembrances with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A heaviness that's gone.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO  I have inly wept	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gods,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And on this couple drop a blessed crown,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For it is you that have chalked forth the way	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which brought us hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  I say "Amen," Gonzalo.	shakespeare	swift	0
GONZALO	shakespeare	swift	0
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Beyond a common joy, and set it down	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage	shakespeare	swift	0
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When no man was his own.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO, [to Ferdinand and Miranda]  Give me your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hands.	shakespeare	swift	0
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That doth not wish you joy!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
GONZALO  Be it so. Amen.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
amazedly following.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I prophesied if a gallows were on land,	shakespeare	swift	0
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shore?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN	shakespeare	swift	0
The best news is that we have safely found	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our king and company. The next: our ship,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We first put out to sea.	shakespeare	swift	0
ARIEL, [aside to Prospero]  Sir, all this service	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have I done since I went.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside to Ariel]  My tricksy spirit!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
These are not natural events. They strengthen	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From strange to stranger.--Say, how came you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hither?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
BOATSWAIN	shakespeare	swift	0
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep	shakespeare	swift	0
And--how, we know not--all clapped under	shakespeare	swift	0
hatches,	shakespeare	swift	0
Where, but even now, with strange and several	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
noises	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We were awaked, straightway at liberty,	shakespeare	swift	0
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cap'ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Even in a dream were we divided from them	shakespeare	swift	0
And were brought moping hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ARIEL, [aside to Prospero]  Was 't well done?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO, [aside to Ariel]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And there is in this business more than nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was ever conduct of. Some oracle	shakespeare	swift	0
Must rectify our knowledge.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Sir, my liege,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not infest your mind with beating on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which to you shall seem probable, of every	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
These happened accidents; till when, be cheerful	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And think of each thing well. [Aside to Ariel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come hither, spirit;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Set Caliban and his companions free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Untie the spell. [Ariel exits.] How fares my gracious	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There are yet missing of your company	shakespeare	swift	0
Some few odd lads that you remember not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in their stolen apparel.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  Every man shift for all the rest, and let no	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  If these be true spies which I wear in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
head, here's a goodly sight.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Ha, ha!	shakespeare	swift	0
What things are these, my Lord Antonio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Will money buy 'em?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Very like. One of them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His mother was a witch, and one so strong	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And deal in her command without her power.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
These three have robbed me, and this demi-devil,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For he's a bastard one, had plotted with them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To take my life. Two of these fellows you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must know and own. This thing of darkness I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Acknowledge mine.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN  I shall be pinched to death.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  He is drunk now. Where had he wine?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO	shakespeare	swift	0
And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Trinculo.] How cam'st thou in this pickle?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TRINCULO  I have been in such a pickle since I saw you	shakespeare	swift	0
last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I	shakespeare	swift	0
shall not fear flyblowing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Why, how now, Stephano?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cramp.	shakespeare	swift	0
PROSPERO  You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
STEPHANO  I should have been a sore one, then.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO, [indicating Caliban]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This is as strange a thing as e'er I looked on.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
He is as disproportioned in his manners	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As in his shape. [To Caliban.] Go, sirrah, to my cell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Take with you your companions. As you look	shakespeare	swift	0
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CALIBAN	shakespeare	swift	0
Ay, that I will, and I'll be wise hereafter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Was I to take this drunkard for a god,	shakespeare	swift	0
And worship this dull fool!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  Go to, away!	shakespeare	swift	0
ALONSO, [to Stephano and Trinculo]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Or stole it, rather.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO	shakespeare	swift	0
Sir, I invite your Highness and your train	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For this one night, which part of it I'll waste	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Go quick away: the story of my life	shakespeare	swift	0
And the particular accidents gone by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since I came to this isle. And in the morn	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where I have hope to see the nuptial	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And thence retire me to my Milan, where	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Every third thought shall be my grave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ALONSO  I long	shakespeare	swift	0
To hear the story of your life, which must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Take the ear strangely.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
PROSPERO  I'll deliver all,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,	shakespeare	swift	0
And sail so expeditious that shall catch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your royal fleet far off. [Aside to Ariel.] My Ariel,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

EPILOGUE,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[spoken by Prospero.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
============================	shakespeare	swift	0
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,	shakespeare	swift	0
And what strength I have 's mine own,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which is most faint. Now 'tis true	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I must be here confined by you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since I have my dukedom got	shakespeare	swift	0
And pardoned the deceiver, dwell	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In this bare island by your spell,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But release me from my bands	shakespeare	swift	0
With the help of your good hands.	shakespeare	swift	0
Gentle breath of yours my sails	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Must fill, or else my project fails,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which was to please. Now I want	shakespeare	swift	0
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And my ending is despair,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless I be relieved by prayer,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which pierces so that it assaults	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mercy itself, and frees all faults.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As you from crimes would pardoned be,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let your indulgence set me free.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with Musicians playing.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
If music be the food of love, play on.	shakespeare	swift	0
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The appetite may sicken and so die.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That strain again! It had a dying fall.	shakespeare	swift	0
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That breathes upon a bank of violets,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Stealing and giving odor. Enough; no more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That, notwithstanding thy capacity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But falls into abatement and low price	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That it alone is high fantastical.	shakespeare	swift	0
CURIO	shakespeare	swift	0
Will you go hunt, my lord?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  What, Curio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CURIO  The hart.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methought she purged the air of pestilence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That instant was I turned into a hart,	shakespeare	swift	0
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,	shakespeare	swift	0
E'er since pursue me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Valentine.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How now, what news from her?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VALENTINE	shakespeare	swift	0
So please my lord, I might not be admitted,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But from her handmaid do return this answer:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The element itself, till seven years' heat,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall not behold her face at ample view,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,	shakespeare	swift	0
And water once a day her chamber round	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With eye-offending brine--all this to season	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And lasting in her sad remembrance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How will she love when the rich golden shaft	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hath killed the flock of all affections else	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Her sweet perfections with one self king!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  What country, friends, is this?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN  This is Illyria, lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
And what should I do in Illyria?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My brother he is in Elysium.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Perchance he is not drowned.--What think you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sailors?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
True, madam. And to comfort you with chance,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When you and those poor number saved with you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,	shakespeare	swift	0
Most provident in peril, bind himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,	shakespeare	swift	0
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So long as I could see.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA, [giving him money]  For saying so, there's gold.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not three hours' travel from this very place.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Who governs here?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A noble duke, in nature as in name.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  What is his name?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN  Orsino.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
Orsino. I have heard my father name him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He was a bachelor then.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And so is now, or was so very late;	shakespeare	swift	0
For but a month ago I went from hence,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And then 'twas fresh in murmur (as, you know,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What great ones do the less will prattle of)	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  What's she?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In the protection of his son, her brother,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,	shakespeare	swift	0
They say, she hath abjured the sight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And company of men.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  O, that I served that lady,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And might not be delivered to the world	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What my estate is.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN  That were hard to compass	shakespeare	swift	0
Because she will admit no kind of suit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No, not the Duke's.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And though that nature with a beauteous wall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With this thy fair and outward character.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I prithee--and I'll pay thee bounteously--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For such disguise as haply shall become	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And speak to him in many sorts of music	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That will allow me very worth his service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What else may hap, to time I will commit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
CAPTAIN	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I thank thee. Lead me on.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Scene 3	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Sir Toby and Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What a plague means my niece to take the death	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
life.	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA  By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
o' nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to your ill hours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Why, let her except before excepted!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Ay, but you must confine yourself within the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
modest limits of order.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than I am.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
themselves in their own straps!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
knight that you brought in one night here to be her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wooer.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Ay, he.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  He's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  What's that to th' purpose?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Why, he has three thousand ducats a year!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He's a very fool and a prodigal.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and speaks three or four languages word	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nature.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  He hath indeed, almost natural, for, besides	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that he's a fool, he's a great quarreler, and, but that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in quarreling, 'tis thought among the prudent he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would quickly have the gift of a grave.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that say so of him. Who are they?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your company.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  With drinking healths to my niece. I'll drink to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her as long as there is a passage in my throat and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drink in Illyria. He's a coward and a coistrel that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
toe like a parish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo,	shakespeare	swift	0
for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Sir Andrew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Sweet Sir Andrew!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [to Maria]  Bless you, fair shrew.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  And you too, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Accost, Sir Andrew, accost!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  What's that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  My niece's chambermaid.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Good Mistress Accost, I desire better	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
acquaintance.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  My name is Mary, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Good Mistress Mary Accost--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  You mistake, knight. "Accost" is front her, board	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her, woo her, assail her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  By my troth, I would not undertake her in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this company. Is that the meaning of "accost"?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Fare you well, gentlemen. [She begins to exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mightst never draw sword again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  An you part so, mistress, I would I might	shakespeare	swift	0
never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have fools in hand?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Sir, I have not you by th' hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Marry, but you shall have, and here's my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hand. [He offers his hand.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA, [taking his hand]  Now sir, thought is free. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pray you, bring your hand to th' butt'ry bar and let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it drink.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
metaphor?	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA  It's dry, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  A dry jest, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Are you full of them?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends. Marry,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
now I let go your hand, I am barren. [Maria exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary! When did	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I see thee so put down?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Never in your life, I think, unless you see	shakespeare	swift	0
canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have	shakespeare	swift	0
no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
has. But I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
does harm to my wit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  No question.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride	shakespeare	swift	0
home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Pourquoi, my dear knight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  What is "pourquoi"? Do, or not do? I would I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fencing, dancing, and bearbaiting. O, had I but	shakespeare	swift	0
followed the arts!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Why, would that have mended my hair?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nature.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  But it becomes me well enough, does 't not?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Excellent! It hangs like flax on a distaff, and I	shakespeare	swift	0
hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and spin it off.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Faith, I'll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
niece will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
she'll none of me. The Count himself here hard by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
woos her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  She'll none o' th' Count. She'll not match above	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heard her swear 't. Tut, there's life in 't, man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
strangest mind i' th' world. I delight in masques	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and revels sometimes altogether.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
compare with an old man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Faith, I can cut a caper.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  And I can cut the mutton to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  And I think I have the back-trick simply as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
strong as any man in Illyria.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
these gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to	shakespeare	swift	0
take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost	shakespeare	swift	0
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. I would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
revels?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What shall we do else? Were we not born under	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Taurus?	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Taurus? That's sides and heart.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
caper. [Sir Andrew dances.] Ha, higher! Ha, ha,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
excellent!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Scene 4	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Valentine, and Viola in man's attire as Cesario.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VALENTINE  If the Duke continue these favors towards	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced. He	shakespeare	swift	0
hath known you but three days, and already you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
are no stranger.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  You either fear his humor or my negligence, that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you call in question the continuance of his love. Is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he inconstant, sir, in his favors?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VALENTINE  No, believe me.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  I thank you.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Orsino, Curio, and Attendants.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here comes the Count.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  Who saw Cesario, ho?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  On your attendance, my lord, here.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO, [to Curio and Attendants]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Stand you awhile aloof.--Cesario,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou know'st no less but all. I have unclasped	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To thee the book even of my secret soul.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be not denied access. Stand at her doors	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Till thou have audience.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Sure, my noble lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If she be so abandoned to her sorrow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Rather than make unprofited return.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
O, then unfold the passion of my love.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It shall become thee well to act my woes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She will attend it better in thy youth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
I think not so, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  Dear lad, believe it;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For they shall yet belie thy happy years	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That say thou art a man. Diana's lip	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And all is semblative a womans part.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I know thy constellation is right apt	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For this affair.--Some four or five attend him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All, if you will, for I myself am best	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When least in company.--Prosper well in this	shakespeare	swift	0
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To call his fortunes thine.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I'll do my best	shakespeare	swift	0
To woo your lady. [Aside.] Yet a barful strife!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Scene 5	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Maria and Feste, the Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
absence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
world needs to fear no colors.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Make that good.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  He shall see none to fear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  A good Lenten answer. I can tell thee where	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that saying was born, of "I fear no colors."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Where, good Mistress Mary?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your foolery.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
those that are Fools, let them use their talents.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hanging to you?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  You are resolute, then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  That if one break, the other will hold, or if both	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
break, your gaskins fall.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Peace, you rogue. No more o' that. Here comes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio and Attendants.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL, [aside]  Wit, an 't be thy will, put me into good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit."--God bless	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee, lady!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Take the Fool away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the Lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Go to, you're a dry Fool. I'll no more of you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Besides, you grow dishonest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
again, take her away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Sir, I bade them take away you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
non facit monachum. That's as much to say as, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me leave to prove you a fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Can you do it?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Dexteriously, good madonna.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Make your proof.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mouse of virtue, answer me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your proof.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Good Fool, for my brother's death.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brother's soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gentlemen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not mend?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ever make the better Fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
twopence that you are no fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  How say you to that, Malvolio?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Fools' zanies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and of free disposition is to take those things	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There	shakespeare	swift	0
is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man, though he do nothing but reprove.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speak'st well of Fools!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much desires to speak with you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  From the Count Orsino, is it?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  I know not, madam. 'Tis a fair young man, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
well attended.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Who of my people hold him in delay?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but madman. Fie on him! [Maria exits.] Go you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. [(Malvolio	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
exits.)] Now you see, sir, how your fooling	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
grows old, and people dislike it.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
son should be a Fool, whose skull Jove cram with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brains, for--here he comes--one of thy kin has a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
most weak pia mater.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Sir Toby.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  By mine honor, half drunk!--What is he at the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gate, cousin?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  A gentleman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  A gentleman? What gentleman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  'Tis a gentleman here--a plague o' these pickle	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
herring!--How now, sot?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Good Sir Toby.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this lethargy?	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Lechery? I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Ay, marry, what is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me faith, say I. Well, it's all one. [He exits.]	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  What's a drunken man like, Fool?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. One	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
draught above heat makes him a fool, the second	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mads him, and a third drowns him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my coz, for he's in the third degree of drink: he's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drowned. Go look after him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  He is but mad yet, madonna, and the Fool shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
look to the madman. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Malvolio.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Madam, yond young fellow swears he will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
on him to understand so much, and therefore	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
comes to speak with you. I told him you were	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to be said to him, lady? He's fortified against any	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
denial.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Tell him he shall not speak with me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Has been told so, and he says he'll stand at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter	shakespeare	swift	0
to a bench, but he'll speak with you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  What kind o' man is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Why, of mankind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  What manner of man?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Of very ill manner. He'll speak with you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will you or no.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Of what personage and years is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Not yet old enough for a man, nor young	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
enough for a boy--as a squash is before 'tis a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple. 'Tis	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with him in standing water, between boy and man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One would think his mother's milk were	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scarce out of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Gentlewoman, my lady calls. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Viola.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  The honorable lady of the house, which is she?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beauty--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
even to the least sinister usage.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Whence came you, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I can say little more than I have studied, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that question's out of my part. Good gentle one,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
house, that I may proceed in my speech.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Are you a comedian?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  No, my profound heart. And yet by the very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you the lady of the house?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  If I do not usurp myself, I am.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with my speech in your praise and then show you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the heart of my message.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Come to what is important in 't. I forgive you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the praise.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
poetical.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and	shakespeare	swift	0
allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reason, be brief. 'Tis not that time of moon with me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to make one in so skipping a dialogue.	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA  Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
longer.--Some mollification for your giant, sweet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lady.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Tell me your mind.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  I am a messenger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
office.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Yet you began rudely. What are you? What	shakespeare	swift	0
would you?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
learned from my entertainment. What I am and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Give us the place alone. We will hear this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
divinity. [Maria and Attendants exit.] Now, sir, what	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is your text?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Most sweet lady--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of it. Where lies your text?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  In Orsino's bosom.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to say?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  Good madam, let me see your face.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Have you any commission from your lord to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
negotiate with my face? You are now out of your	shakespeare	swift	0
text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
picture. [She removes her veil.] Look you, sir, such a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one I was this present. Is 't not well done?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Excellently done, if God did all.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
weather.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you will lead these graces to the grave	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And leave the world no copy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled	shakespeare	swift	0
to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
two gray eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one	shakespeare	swift	0
chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
I see you what you are. You are too proud.	shakespeare	swift	0
But if you were the devil you are fair.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My lord and master loves you. O, such love	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Could be but recompensed though you were	shakespeare	swift	0
crowned	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The nonpareil of beauty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  How does he love me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  With adorations, fertile tears,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And in dimension and the shape of nature	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He might have took his answer long ago.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
If I did love you in my master's flame,	shakespeare	swift	0
With such a suff'ring, such a deadly life,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In your denial I would find no sense.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would not understand it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Why, what would you?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
Make me a willow cabin at your gate	shakespeare	swift	0
And call upon my soul within the house,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Write loyal cantons of contemned love	shakespeare	swift	0
And sing them loud even in the dead of night,	shakespeare	swift	0
Hallow your name to the reverberate hills	shakespeare	swift	0
And make the babbling gossip of the air	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cry out "Olivia!" O, you should not rest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Between the elements of air and earth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But you should pity me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  You might do much.	shakespeare	swift	0
What is your parentage?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am a gentleman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Get you to your lord.	shakespeare	swift	0
I cannot love him. Let him send no more--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless perchance you come to me again	shakespeare	swift	0
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[She offers money.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
I am no fee'd post, lady. Keep your purse.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And let your fervor, like my master's, be	shakespeare	swift	0
Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty. [She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  "What is your parentage?"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am a gentleman." I'll be sworn thou art.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
soft!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Unless the master were the man. How now?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections	shakespeare	swift	0

[Enter Antonio and Sebastian.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I go with you?	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps	shakespeare	swift	0
distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad	shakespeare	swift	0
recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Let me yet know of you whither you are	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bound.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent	shakespeare	swift	0
a touch of modesty that you will not extort	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
charges me in manners the rather to express myself.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You must know of me, then, Antonio, my name	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
both born in an hour. If the heavens had been	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
altered that, for some hour before you took me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Alas the day!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A lady, sir, though it was said she much	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.	shakespeare	swift	0
But though I could not with such estimable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
though I seem to drown her remembrance again	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  If you will not murder me for my love, let me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be your servant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  If you will not undo what you have done--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that is, kill him whom you have recovered--desire	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it not. Fare you well at once. My bosom is full of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Orsino's court. Farewell. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Else would I very shortly see thee there.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But come what may, I do adore thee so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

MALVOLIO  Were not you even now with the Countess	shakespeare	swift	0
Olivia?	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
arrived but hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  She returns this ring to you, sir. You might	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have saved me my pains to have taken it away	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your lord into a desperate assurance she will none	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of him. And one thing more, that you be never so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
report your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  She took the ring of me. I'll none of it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her will is it should be so returned. [He throws	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
down the ring.] If it be worth stooping for, there it	shakespeare	swift	0

Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She made good view of me, indeed so much	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For she did speak in starts distractedly.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Invites me in this churlish messenger.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
None of my lord's ring? Why, he sent her none!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am the man. If it be so, as 'tis,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

How easy is it for the proper false	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For such as we are made of, such we be.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What will become of this? As I am man,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My state is desperate for my master's love.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As I am woman (now, alas the day!),	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O Time, thou must untangle this, not I.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It is too hard a knot for me t' untie.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
midnight is to be up betimes, and "diluculo surgere,"	shakespeare	swift	0
thou know'st--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Nay, by my troth, I know not. But I know to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be up late is to be up late.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
elements?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists	shakespeare	swift	0
of eating and drinking.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Thou 'rt a scholar. Let us therefore eat and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
drink. Marian, I say, a stoup of wine!	shakespeare	swift	0

FOOL  How now, my hearts? Did you never see the	shakespeare	swift	0

TOBY  Welcome, ass! Now let's have a catch.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  By my troth, the Fool has an excellent breast.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and so sweet a breath to sing, as the Fool has.--In	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when thou spok'st of Pigrogromitus of the Vapians	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
passing the equinoctial of Queubus. 'Twas very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hadst it?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio's nose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
is no whipstock, my lady has a white hand, and the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
all is done. Now, a song!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [giving money to the Fool]  Come on, there is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sixpence for you. Let's have a song.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [giving money to the Fool]  There's a testril of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me, too. If one knight give a--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Would you have a love song or a song of good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
life?	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  A love song, a love song.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Ay, ay, I care not for good life.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Trip no further, pretty sweeting.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Journeys end in lovers meeting,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  Good, good.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What is love? 'Tis not hereafter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Present mirth hath present laughter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What's to come is still unsure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In delay there lies no plenty,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Youth's a stuff will not endure.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  A contagious breath.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  An you love me, let's do 't. I am dog at a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
catch.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  By 'r Lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Most certain. Let our catch be "Thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Knave."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  "Hold thy peace, thou knave," knight? I shall be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
constrained in 't to call thee "knave," knight.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  'Tis not the first time I have constrained one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to call me "knave." Begin, Fool. It begins "Hold	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

MARIA  What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's	shakespeare	swift	0

FOOL  Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and so do I, too. He does it with a better grace, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I do it more natural.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [sings]  O' the twelfth day of December--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  For the love o' God, peace!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Malvolio.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  My masters, are you mad? Or what are you?	shakespeare	swift	0
Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you	shakespeare	swift	0
make an ale-house of my lady's house, that you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation	shakespeare	swift	0
or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
place, persons, nor time in you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bade me tell you that, though she harbors you as her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If	shakespeare	swift	0
you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,	shakespeare	swift	0
you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Nay, good Sir Toby.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

His eyes do show his days are almost done.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O no, no, no, no, you dare not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Out o' tune, sir? You lie. Art any more than a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there shall be no more cakes and ale?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mouth, too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Thou 'rt i' th' right.--Go, sir, rub your chain	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with crumbs.--A stoup of wine, Maria!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at anything more than contempt, you would not give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this hand. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

then to break promise with him and make a fool of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Do 't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge. Or I'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
youth of the Count's was today with my lady, she is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and make him a common recreation, do not think I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
can do it.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dear knight?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I have no exquisite reason for 't, but I have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reason good enough.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  The devil a puritan that he is, or anything	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
constantly but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that cons state without book and utters it by great	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
swaths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of faith that all that look on him love him. And on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to work.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What wilt thou do?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
most feelingly personated. I can write very like my	shakespeare	swift	0
lady your niece; on a forgotten matter, we can	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hardly make distinction of our hands.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Excellent! I smell a device.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I have 't in my nose, too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that they come from my niece, and that she's in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
love with him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  My purpose is indeed a horse of that color.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  And your horse now would make him an ass.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Ass, I doubt not.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  O, 'twill be admirable!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and dream on the event. Farewell.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Good night, Penthesilea. [She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Before me, she's a good wench.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me. What o' that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I was adored once, too.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more money.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
out.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That old and antique song we heard last night.	shakespeare	swift	0
Methought it did relieve my passion much,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

VIOLA  About your years, my lord.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

So sways she level in her husband's heart.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  There is no woman's sides	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.	shakespeare	swift	0
Alas, their love may be called appetite,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No motion of the liver but the palate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

A blank, my lord. She never told her love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We men may say more, swear more, but indeed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more exalted respect than anyone else that follows	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her. What should I think on 't?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Here's an overweening rogue.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
turkeycock of him. How he jets under his advanced	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
plumes!	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW, [aside]  'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [aside]  Peace, I say.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  To be Count Malvolio.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [aside]  Ah, rogue!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  Pistol him, pistol him!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Peace, peace!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  There is example for 't. The lady of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  Fie on him, Jezebel!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, now he's deeply in. Look how	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
imagination blows him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Having been three months married to her,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sitting in my state--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Calling my officers about me, in my	shakespeare	swift	0
branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
where I have left Olivia sleeping--	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [aside]  Fire and brimstone!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, peace!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  And then to have the humor of state; and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
after a demure travel of regard, telling them I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ask for my kinsman Toby--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Bolts and shackles!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Seven of my people, with an obedient start,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wind up my watch, or play with my--some	shakespeare	swift	0
rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Shall this fellow live?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  Though our silence be drawn from us	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with cars, yet peace!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  I extend my hand to him thus, quenching	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my familiar smile with an austere regard of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
control--	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [aside]  And does not Toby take you a blow o' the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lips then?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  Saying, "Cousin Toby, my fortunes, having	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speech--"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  What, what?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "You must amend your drunkenness."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Out, scab!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  Nay, patience, or we break the sinews	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of our plot!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "Besides, you waste the treasure of your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
time with a foolish knight--"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  That's me, I warrant you.	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  "One Sir Andrew."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  I knew 'twas I, for many do call me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fool.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO, [seeing the letter]  What employment have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
we here?	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN, [aside]  Now is the woodcock near the gin.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reading aloud to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO, [taking up the letter]  By my life, this is my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lady's hand! These be her very c's, her u's, and her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
t's, and thus she makes her great P's. It is in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
contempt of question her hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  Her c's, her u's, and her t's. Why that?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO [reads]  To the unknown beloved, this, and my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good wishes--Her very phrases! By your leave, wax.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
she uses to seal--'tis my lady! [He opens the letter.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To whom should this be?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  This wins him, liver and all.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO [reads]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Jove knows I love,	shakespeare	swift	0
But who?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lips, do not move;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No man must know.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"No man must know." What follows? The numbers	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
altered. "No man must know." If this should be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee, Malvolio!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Marry, hang thee, brock!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO [reads]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I may command where I adore,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But silence, like a Lucrece knife,	shakespeare	swift	0
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  A fustian riddle!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Excellent wench, say I.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "M.O.A.I. doth sway my life." Nay, but first	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
let me see, let me see, let me see.	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN, [aside]  What dish o' poison has she dressed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  And with what wing the staniel checks	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
at it!	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  "I may command where I adore." Why, she	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may command me; I serve her; she is my lady. Why,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
obstruction in this. And the end--what should that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
alphabetical position portend? If I could make that	shakespeare	swift	0
resemble something in me! Softly! "M.O.A.I."--	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [aside]  O, ay, make up that.--He is now at a cold	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scent.	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN, [aside]  Sowter will cry upon 't for all this,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
though it be as rank as a fox.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "M"--Malvolio. "M"--why, that begins	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my name!	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN, [aside]  Did not I say he would work it out? The	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cur is excellent at faults.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "M." But then there is no consonancy in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the sequel that suffers under probation. "A" should	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
follow, but "O" does.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  And "O" shall end, I hope.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Ay, or I'll cudgel him and make him cry	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
"O."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  And then "I" comes behind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside]  Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
before you.	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  "M.O.A.I." This simulation is not as the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Soft, here follows prose.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He reads.] If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
some have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy fates open	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She thus advises thee that sighs for thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember.	shakespeare	swift	0
Go to, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so. If	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The Fortunate-Unhappy.	shakespeare	swift	0
Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will be point-devise the very man. I do not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be	shakespeare	swift	0
praised! Here is yet a postscript.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He reads.] Thou canst not choose but know who I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
am. If thou entertain'st my love, let it appear in thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that thou wilt have me. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  I will not give my part of this sport for a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  I could marry this wench for this device.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  So could I too.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  And ask no other dowry with her but such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
another jest.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Nor I neither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Here comes my noble gull-catcher.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Or o' mine either?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thy bondslave?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I' faith, or I either?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Like aqua vitae with a midwife.	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA  If you will then see the fruits of the sport,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mark his first approach before my lady. He will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
come to her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a color	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and he will smile upon her, which will now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
see it, follow me.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of wit!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I'll make one, too.	shakespeare	swift	0

=======	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Viola and Feste, the Fool, playing a tabor.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
by thy tabor?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  No, sir, I live by the church.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Art thou a churchman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
church.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beggar dwell near him, or the church stands by thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tabor if thy tabor stand by the church.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but a chev'ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wrong side may be turned outward!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Nay, that's certain. They that dally nicely with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
words may quickly make them wanton.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I would therefore my sister had had no name,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Why, man?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that word might make my sister wanton. But,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgraced	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Thy reason, man?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and words are grown so false I am loath to prove	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
reason with them.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
nothing.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Not so, sir. I do care for something. But in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
invisible.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  Art not thou the Lady Olivia's Fool?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  No, indeed, sir. The Lady Olivia has no folly. She	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will keep no Fool, sir, till she be married, and Fools	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings: the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
husband's the bigger. I am indeed not her Fool but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
her corrupter of words.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Fool should be as oft with your master as with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my mistress. I think I saw your Wisdom there.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee. Hold, there's expenses for thee. [Giving a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
coin.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee a beard!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  By my troth I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one, [aside] though I would not have it grow on my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
chin.--Is thy lady within?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Yes, being kept together and put to use.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bring a Cressida to this Troilus.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I understand you, sir. 'Tis well begged. [Giving	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
another coin.]	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  The matter I hope is not great, sir, begging but a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I will conster to them whence you come. Who you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
are and what you would are out of my welkin--I	shakespeare	swift	0
might say "element," but the word is overworn.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
This fellow is wise enough to play the Fool,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And to do that well craves a kind of wit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The quality of persons, and the time,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And, like the haggard, check at every feather	shakespeare	swift	0
That comes before his eye. This is a practice	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As full of labor as a wise man's art:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Sir Toby and Andrew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Save you, gentleman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  And you, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Dieu vous garde, monsieur.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Will you encounter the house? My niece is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
list of my voyage.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  My legs do better understand me, sir, than I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
legs.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  I mean, to go, sir, to enter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I will answer you with gait and entrance--but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
we are prevented.	shakespeare	swift	0

most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [aside]  "Odors," "pregnant," and "vouchsafed."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
My servant, sir? 'Twas never merry world	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.	shakespeare	swift	0

And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
On his behalf.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  O, by your leave, I pray you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I bade you never speak again of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But would you undertake another suit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I had rather hear you to solicit that	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than music from the spheres.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Dear lady--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
After the last enchantment you did here,	shakespeare	swift	0
A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Under your hard construction must I sit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To force that on you in a shameful cunning	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which you knew none of yours. What might you	shakespeare	swift	0
think?	shakespeare	swift	0
Have you not set mine honor at the stake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your	shakespeare	swift	0
receiving	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
I pity you.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  That's a degree to love.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That very oft we pity enemies.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Why then methinks 'tis time to smile again.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If one should be a prey, how much the better	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To fall before the lion than the wolf. [Clock strikes.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.	shakespeare	swift	0
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your wife is like to reap a proper man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There lies your way, due west.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Then westward ho!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Cesario, by the roses of the spring,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But rather reason thus with reason fetter:	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
By innocence I swear, and by my youth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

ANDREW  Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me. I saw 't i' th' orchard.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  As plain as I see you now.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  This was a great argument of love in her toward	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
judgment and reason.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  And they have been grand-jurymen since before	shakespeare	swift	0
Noah was a sailor.	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN  She did show favor to the youth in your sight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse	shakespeare	swift	0
valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your liver. You should then have accosted her, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you should have banged the youth into dumbness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This was looked for at your hand, and this was	shakespeare	swift	0
balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north	shakespeare	swift	0
of my lady's opinion, where you will hang like an	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
it by some laudable attempt either of valor or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
policy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  An 't be any way, it must be with valor, for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a	shakespeare	swift	0
politician.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of valor. Challenge me the Count's youth to fight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
take note of it, and assure thyself there is no	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
commendation with woman than report of valor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and	shakespeare	swift	0
brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ink. If thou "thou"-est him some thrice, it shall not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
paper, although the sheet were big enough for the	shakespeare	swift	0
bed of Ware in England, set 'em down. Go, about it.	shakespeare	swift	0
Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Where shall I find you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  We'll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Sir Andrew exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
strong or so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  We shall have a rare letter from him. But you'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not deliver 't?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
opened and you find so much blood in his liver as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of th'	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
anatomy.	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN  And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
no great presage of cruelty.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Look where the youngest wren of mine comes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is	shakespeare	swift	0
turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.	shakespeare	swift	0
He's in yellow stockings.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  And cross-gartered?	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA  Most villainously, like a pedant that keeps a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
school i' th' church. I have dogged him like his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
murderer. He does obey every point of the letter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
into more lines than is in the new map with the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
smile and take 't for a great favor.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

I will no further chide you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I could not stay behind you. My desire,	shakespeare	swift	0
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And not all love to see you, though so much	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

SEBASTIAN  My kind Antonio,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I can no other answer make but thanks,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You should find better dealing. What's to do?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Shall we go see the relics of this town?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

ANTONIO  Would you'd pardon me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I do not without danger walk these streets.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Once in a sea fight 'gainst the Count his galleys	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Belike you slew great number of his people?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Th' offense is not of such a bloody nature,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Might well have given us bloody argument.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
It might have since been answered in repaying	shakespeare	swift	0
What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I shall pay dear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  Do not then walk too open.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

OLIVIA, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I have sent after him. He says he'll come.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For youth is bought more oft than begged or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
borrowed.	shakespeare	swift	0
I speak too loud.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where's Malvolio? He is sad and civil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where is Malvolio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He is sure possessed, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Why, what's the matter? Does he rave?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ladyship were best to have some guard about you if	shakespeare	swift	0
he come, for sure the man is tainted in 's wits.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Go call him hither. [Maria exits.] I am as mad as he,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If sad and merry madness equal be.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Maria with Malvolio.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How now, Malvolio?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  Sweet lady, ho, ho!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Smil'st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
occasion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Sad, lady? I could be sad. This does make	shakespeare	swift	0
some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with me as the very true sonnet is: "Please one, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
please all."	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with thee?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Not black in my mind, though yellow in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman	shakespeare	swift	0
hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  To bed? "Ay, sweetheart, and I'll come to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thee."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
kiss thy hand so oft?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  How do you, Malvolio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  At your request? Yes, nightingales answer	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
daws!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
before my lady?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "Be not afraid of greatness." 'Twas well	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
writ.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  What mean'st thou by that, Malvolio?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  "Some are born great--"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Ha?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  "Some achieve greatness--"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

OLIVIA  Why, this is very midsummer madness!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Servant.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SERVANT  Madam, the young gentleman of the Count	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Orsino's is returned. I could hardly entreat him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
back. He attends your Ladyship's pleasure.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  I'll come to him. [Servant exits.] Good Maria, let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this fellow be looked to. Where's my Cousin Toby?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let some of my people have a special care of him. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would not have him miscarry for the half of my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dowry.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Olivia and Maria exit in different directions.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  O ho, do you come near me now? No worse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me to that in the letter: "Cast thy humble slough,"	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
says she. "Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
state; put thyself into the trick of singularity," and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad	shakespeare	swift	0
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful!	shakespeare	swift	0
And when she went away now, "Let this fellow be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
looked to." "Fellow!" Not "Malvolio," nor after my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
degree, but "fellow." Why, everything adheres together,	shakespeare	swift	0
that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
circumstance--what can be said? Nothing that can	shakespeare	swift	0
be can come between me and the full prospect of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he is to be thanked.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Here he is, here he is.--How is 't with you, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How is 't with you, man?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my	shakespeare	swift	0
private. Go off.	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA, [to Toby]  Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
prays you to have a care of him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Aha, does she so?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [to Fabian and Maria]  Go to, go to! Peace, peace.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We must deal gently with him. Let me alone.--How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
do you, Malvolio? How is 't with you? What, man,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
defy the devil! Consider, he's an enemy to mankind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Do you know what you say?	shakespeare	swift	0
MARIA, [to Toby]  La you, an you speak ill of the devil,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bewitched!	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN  Carry his water to th' wisewoman.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

I'll say.	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  How now, mistress?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  O Lord!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you not see you move him? Let me alone with	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [to Malvolio]  Why, how now, my bawcock? How	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
dost thou, chuck?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Sir!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Ay, biddy, come with me.--What, man, 'tis not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him, foul collier!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby; get	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him to pray.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  My prayers, minx?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA, [to Toby]  No, I warrant you, he will not hear of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
godliness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Go hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow	shakespeare	swift	0
things. I am not of your element. You shall	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
know more hereafter. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Is 't possible?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  If this were played upon a stage now, I could	shakespeare	swift	0
condemn it as an improbable fiction.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  His very genius hath taken the infection of the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
device, man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and taint.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Why, we shall make him mad indeed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  The house will be the quieter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Come, we'll have him in a dark room and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bound. My niece is already in the belief that he's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
finder of madmen. But see, but see!	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Sir Andrew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  More matter for a May morning.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [presenting a paper]  Here's the challenge.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Read it. I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Is 't so saucy?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Ay, is 't. I warrant him. Do but read.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Give me. [He reads.] Youth, whatsoever thou art,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou art but a scurvy fellow.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Good, and valiant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [reads]  Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  A good note, that keeps you from the blow of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the law.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [reads]  Thou com'st to the Lady Olivia, and in my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that is not the matter I challenge thee for.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [reads]  I will waylay thee going home, where if it be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thy chance to kill me--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Good.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [reads]  Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Still you keep o' th' windy side of the law.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Good.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY [reads]  Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Andrew Aguecheek.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
give 't him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MARIA  You may have very fit occasion for 't. He is now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in some commerce with my lady and will by and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
by depart.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever	shakespeare	swift	0
thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw'st, swear	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
manhood more approbation than ever proof itself	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would have earned him. Away!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Nay, let me alone for swearing. [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
capacity and breeding; his employment between	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
will so fright them both that they will kill one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
another by the look, like cockatrices.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Olivia and Viola.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Here he comes with your niece. Give them	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  You'll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore,	shakespeare	swift	0
if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your	shakespeare	swift	0
guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I pray you, sir, what is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his incensement at this moment is so implacable	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and sepulcher. "Hob, nob" is his word; "give 't or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
take 't."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I will return again into the house and desire	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man of that quirk.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
competent injury. Therefore get you on and give	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
unless you undertake that with me which with as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me this courteous office, as to know of the knight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
what my offense to him is. It is something of my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
negligence, nothing of my purpose.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  I will do so.--Signior Fabian, stay you by this	shakespeare	swift	0
gentleman till my return. [Toby exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  I know the knight is incensed against you even	shakespeare	swift	0
to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
more.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I beseech you, what manner of man is he?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him by his form, as you are like to find him in the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly	shakespeare	swift	0
have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
can.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  I shall be much bound to you for 't. I am one	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
care not who knows so much of my mettle.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[They exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Toby and Andrew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Why, man, he's a very devil. I have not seen such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ground they step on. They say he has been fencer	shakespeare	swift	0
to the Sophy.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Pox on 't! I'll not meddle with him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scarce hold him yonder.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Plague on 't! An I thought he had been	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
valiant, and so cunning in fence, I'd have seen him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, gray	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Capilet.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  I'll make the motion. Stand here, make a good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
show on 't. This shall end without the perdition of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
souls. [Aside.] Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ride you.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Fabian and Viola.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Toby crosses to meet them.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Aside to Fabian.] I have his horse to take up the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN, [aside to Toby]  He is as horribly conceited of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him, and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
heels.	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY, [to Viola]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fight	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with you for 's oath sake. Marry, he hath better	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
hurt you.	shakespeare	swift	0
VIOLA  Pray God defend me! [Aside.] A little thing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
would make me tell them how much I lack of a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Give ground if you see him furious.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Toby crosses to Andrew.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy. The	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gentleman will, for his honor's sake, have one bout	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
he will not hurt you. Come on, to 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [drawing his sword]  Pray God he keep his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
oath!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA, [drawing her sword]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I do assure you 'tis against my will.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Antonio.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO, [to Andrew]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Have done offense, I take the fault on me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If you offend him, I for him defy you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  You, sir? Why, what are you?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO, [drawing his sword]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [drawing his sword]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Officers.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  O, good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [to Antonio]  I'll be with you anon.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA, [to Andrew]  Pray, sir, put your sword up, if	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you please.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
easily, and reins well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST OFFICER  This is the man. Do thy office.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND OFFICER  Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Count Orsino.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANTONIO  You do mistake me, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST OFFICER	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.--	shakespeare	swift	0
Take him away. He knows I know him well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I must obey. [To Viola.] This comes with seeking	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you.	shakespeare	swift	0
But there's no remedy. I shall answer it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What will you do, now my necessity	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me	shakespeare	swift	0
Much more for what I cannot do for you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But be of comfort.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND OFFICER  Come, sir, away.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO, [to Viola]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I must entreat of you some of that money.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  What money, sir?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For the fair kindness you have showed me here,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And part being prompted by your present trouble,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Out of my lean and low ability	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll lend you something. My having is not much.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I'll make division of my present with you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hold, there's half my coffer. [Offering him money.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Will you deny me now?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Is 't possible that my deserts to you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lest that it make me so unsound a man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That I have done for you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  I know of none,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Nor know I you by voice or any feature.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I hate ingratitude more in a man	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Inhabits our frail blood--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  O heavens themselves!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SECOND OFFICER  Come, sir, I pray you go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And to his image, which methought did promise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST OFFICER	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What's that to us? The time goes by. Away!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But O, how vile an idol proves this god!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
None can be called deformed but the unkind.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST OFFICER	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The man grows mad. Away with him.--Come,	shakespeare	swift	0
come, sir.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Lead me on.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Antonio and Officers exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Methinks his words do from such passion fly	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That he believes himself; so do not I.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We'll	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Toby, Fabian, and Andrew move aside.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He named Sebastian. I my brother know	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet living in my glass. Even such and so	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In favor was my brother, and he went	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Still in this fashion, color, ornament,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For him I imitate. O, if it prove,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!	shakespeare	swift	0
[She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  A very dishonest, paltry boy, and more a coward	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
friend here in necessity and denying him; and for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his cowardship, ask Fabian.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  A coward, a most devout coward, religious	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
in it.	shakespeare	swift	0
ANDREW  'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sword.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  An I do not--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Come, let's see the event.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

[Enter Sebastian and Feste, the Fool.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Will you make me believe that I am not sent for	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you?	shakespeare	swift	0
SEBASTIAN  Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me be clear of thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Well held out, i' faith. No, I do not know you, nor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speak with her, nor your name is not Master	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that is so is so.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou know'st not me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Vent my folly? He has heard that word of some	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
great man and now applies it to a Fool. Vent my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
folly? I am afraid this great lubber the world will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
vent to her that thou art coming?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's money for thee. [Giving money.] If you	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
men that give Fools money get themselves a good	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
report--after fourteen years' purchase.	shakespeare	swift	0
[Enter Andrew, Toby, and Fabian.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW, [to Sebastian]  Now, sir, have I met you again?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
There's for you. [He strikes Sebastian.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [returning the blow]  Why, there's for thee,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and there, and there.--Are all the people mad?	shakespeare	swift	0
TOBY  Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
house.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL, [aside]  This will I tell my lady straight. I would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not be in some of your coats for twopence.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [seizing Sebastian]  Come on, sir, hold!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Nay, let him alone. I'll go another way to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
work with him. I'll have an action of battery against	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
him first, yet it's no matter for that.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [to Toby]  Let go thy hand!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed.	shakespeare	swift	0
Come on.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
I will be free from thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

What wouldst thou now?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
two of this malapert blood from you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Rudesby, begone! [Toby, Andrew, and Fabian exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I prithee, gentle friend,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In this uncivil and unjust extent	shakespeare	swift	0
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He started one poor heart of mine, in thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN, [aside]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What relish is in this? How runs the stream?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

it quickly. I'll call Sir Toby the whilst. [She exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Well, I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
't, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled	shakespeare	swift	0
in such a gown. [He puts on gown and beard.] I am	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
not tall enough to become the function well, nor	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The competitors enter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Toby and Maria.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY  Jove bless thee, Master Parson.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Bonos dies, Sir Toby; for, as the old hermit of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said	shakespeare	swift	0
to a niece of King Gorboduc "That that is, is," so I,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

MALVOLIO  Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my lady--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
TOBY, [aside]  Well said, Master Parson.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
laid me here in hideous darkness--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayst	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou that house is dark?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  As hell, Sir Topas.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and the clerestories toward the south-north	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou of obstruction?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
house is dark.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the Egyptians in their fog.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  I say this house is as dark as ignorance,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
there was never man thus abused. I am no more	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
constant question.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wildfowl?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  That the soul of our grandam might haply	shakespeare	swift	0

FOOL  What thinkst thou of his opinion?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  I think nobly of the soul, and no way	shakespeare	swift	0
approve his opinion.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou shalt hold th' opinion of Pythagoras ere I will	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  To him in thine own voice, and bring me word	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
how thou find'st him. I would we were well rid	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I would he were, for I am now so far in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FOOL  Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Fool, there was never man so notoriously	shakespeare	swift	0
abused. I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

you, good Sir Topas. [As Sir Topas.] Marry, amen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[As Fool.] I will, sir, I will.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Fool! Fool! Fool, I say!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
shent for speaking to you.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Good Fool, help me to some light and some	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
paper. I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
man in Illyria.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Welladay that you were, sir!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  By this hand, I am. Good Fool, some ink,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
bearing of letter did.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  I will help you to 't. But tell me true, are you not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO  Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

In a trice, like to the old Vice,	shakespeare	swift	0
Your need to sustain.	shakespeare	swift	0
Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

This is the air; that is the glorious sun.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This pearl she gave me, I do feel 't and see 't.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I could not find him at the Elephant.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,	shakespeare	swift	0
That he did range the town to seek me out.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
His counsel now might do me golden service.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For though my soul disputes well with my sense	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That this may be some error, but no madness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,	shakespeare	swift	0
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To any other trust but that I am mad--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or else the lady's mad. Yet if 'twere so,	shakespeare	swift	0
She could not sway her house, command her	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
followers,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
As I perceive she does. There's something in 't	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Olivia, and a Priest.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA, [to Sebastian]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now go with me and with this holy man	shakespeare	swift	0
Into the chantry by. There, before him	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And underneath that consecrated roof,	shakespeare	swift	0
Plight me the full assurance of your faith,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May live at peace. He shall conceal it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What time we will our celebration keep	shakespeare	swift	0
According to my birth. What do you say?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll follow this good man and go with you,	shakespeare	swift	0
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FOOL  Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Anything.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Do not desire to see this letter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

FOOL  Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
for my friends.	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  No, sir, the worse.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  How can that be?	shakespeare	swift	0
FOOL  Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the better for my foes.	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO  Why, this is excellent.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  By my troth, sir, no--though it please you to be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
one of my friends.	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO, [giving a coin]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there's gold.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you could make it another.	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO  O, you give me ill counsel.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and let your flesh and blood obey it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
double-dealer: there's another. [He gives a coin.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
sir, may put you in mind--one, two, three.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO  You can fool no more money out of me at this	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
speak with her, and bring her along with you, it	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
may awake my bounty further.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
That face of his I do remember well.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared	shakespeare	swift	0
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A baubling vessel was he captain of,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With which such scatheful grapple did he make	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With the most noble bottom of our fleet	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That very envy and the tongue of loss	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Cried fame and honor on him.--What's the matter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FIRST OFFICER	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Orsino, this is that Antonio	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And this is he that did the Tiger board	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In private brabble did we apprehend him.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I know not what 'twas but distraction.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Hast made thine enemies?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO  Orsino, noble sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give	shakespeare	swift	0
me.	shakespeare	swift	0
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That most ingrateful boy there by your side	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.	shakespeare	swift	0
His life I gave him and did thereto add	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
My love, without retention or restraint,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
All his in dedication. For his sake	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Into the danger of this adverse town;	shakespeare	swift	0
Drew to defend him when he was beset;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Where, being apprehended, his false cunning	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And grew a twenty years' removed thing	shakespeare	swift	0
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I had recommended to his use	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Not half an hour before.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
VIOLA  How can this be?	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO, [to Antonio]  When came he to this town?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANTONIO	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Father, I charge thee by thy reverence	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

A contract of eternal bond of love,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Attested by the holy close of lips,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Strengthened by interchangement of your rings,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

Sealed in my function, by my testimony;	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

I have traveled but two hours.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO, [to Viola]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

OLIVIA  What's the matter?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  Has broke my head across, and has given Sir	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at	shakespeare	swift	0
home.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ANDREW  The Count's gentleman, one Cesario. We took	shakespeare	swift	0

incardinate.	shakespeare	swift	0
ORSINO  My gentleman Cesario?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

VIOLA	shakespeare	swift	0
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.	shakespeare	swift	0

FOOL  O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

TOBY  Then he's a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

SEBASTIAN, [looking at Viola]	shakespeare	swift	0
Do I stand there? I never had a brother,	shakespeare	swift	0

Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Such a Sebastian was my brother too.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So went he suited to his watery tomb.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If spirits can assume both form and suit,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You come to fright us.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
SEBASTIAN  A spirit I am indeed,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

SEBASTIAN, [to Olivia]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

You would have been contracted to a maid.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1

And yet, alas, now I remember me,	shakespeare	swift	0
They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
A most extracting frenzy of mine own	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
From my remembrance clearly banished his.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To the Fool.] How does he, sirrah?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
writ a letter to you. I should have given 't you today	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
morning. But as a madman's epistles are no gospels,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
so it skills not much when they are delivered.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Open 't and read it.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Look then to be well edified, when the Fool	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
delivers the madman. [He reads.] By the Lord,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
madam--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  How now, art thou mad?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  No, madam, I do but read madness. An your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
allow vox.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  So I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
read thus. Therefore, perpend, my princess, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
give ear.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA, [giving letter to Fabian]  Read it you, sirrah.	shakespeare	swift	0
FABIAN [(reads)]  By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the world shall know it. Though you have put me into	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and speak out of my injury.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The madly used Malvolio.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Did he write this?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Ay, madam.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
This savors not much of distraction.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
See him delivered, Fabian. Bring him hither.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Fabian exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Orsino.] My lord, so please you, these things	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
further thought on,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
To think me as well a sister as a wife,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
One day shall crown th' alliance on 't, so please	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you,	shakespeare	swift	0
Here at my house, and at my proper cost.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Madam, I am most apt t' embrace your offer.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[To Viola.] Your master quits you; and for your	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
service done him,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So much against the mettle of your sex,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And since you called me "master" for so long,	shakespeare	swift	0
Here is my hand. You shall from this time be	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Your master's mistress.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA, [to Viola]  A sister! You are she.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[Enter Malvolio and Fabian.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Is this the madman?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA  Ay, my lord, this same.--	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How now, Malvolio?	shakespeare	swift	0
MALVOLIO  Madam, you have done me	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
wrong,	shakespeare	swift	0
Notorious wrong.	shakespeare	swift	0
OLIVIA  Have I, Malvolio? No.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO, [handing her a paper]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You must not now deny it is your hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,	shakespeare	swift	0
Or say 'tis not your seal, not your invention.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And tell me, in the modesty of honor,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why you have given me such clear lights of favor?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you,	shakespeare	swift	0
To put on yellow stockings, and to frown	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people?	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And, acting this in an obedient hope,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And made the most notorious geck and gull	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That e'er invention played on? Tell me why.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Though I confess much like the character.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But out of question, 'tis Maria's hand.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And now I do bethink me, it was she	shakespeare	swift	0
First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And in such forms which here were presupposed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,	shakespeare	swift	0
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of thine own cause.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FABIAN  Good madam, hear me speak,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Taint the condition of this present hour,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Which I have wondered at. In hope it shall not,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Set this device against Malvolio here,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We had conceived against him. Maria writ	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
In recompense whereof he hath married her.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
How with a sportful malice it was followed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
If that the injuries be justly weighed	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
That have on both sides passed.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA, [to Malvolio]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL  Why, "some are born great, some achieve greatness,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
and some have greatness thrown upon them."	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
but that's all one. "By the Lord, Fool, I am not	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
mad"--but, do you remember "Madam, why laugh	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he's	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
gagged"? And thus the whirligig of time brings in	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
his revenges.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
MALVOLIO	shakespeare	swift	0
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you! [He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
OLIVIA	shakespeare	swift	0
He hath been most notoriously abused.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
ORSINO	shakespeare	swift	0
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace. [Some exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
He hath not told us of the Captain yet.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When that is known, and golden time convents,	shakespeare	swift	0
A solemn combination shall be made	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
Of our dear souls.--Meantime, sweet sister,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
We will not part from hence.--Cesario, come,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For so you shall be while you are a man.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
But when in other habits you are seen,	shakespeare	swift	0
Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[All but the Fool exit.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
FOOL [sings]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
When that I was and a little tiny boy,	shakespeare	swift	0
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	shakespeare	swift	0
A foolish thing was but a toy,	shakespeare	swift	0
For the rain it raineth every day.	shakespeare	swift	0
But when I came to man's estate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	shakespeare	swift	0
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For the rain it raineth every day.	shakespeare	swift	0
But when I came, alas, to wive,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	shakespeare	swift	0
By swaggering could I never thrive,	shakespeare	swift	0
For the rain it raineth every day.	shakespeare	swift	0
But when I came unto my beds,	shakespeare	swift	0
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	shakespeare	swift	0
With tosspots still had drunken heads,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
For the rain it raineth every day.	shakespeare	swift	0
A great while ago the world begun,	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	shakespeare	swift	0
But that's all one, our play is done,	shakespeare	swift	0
And we'll strive to please you every day.	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
[He exits.]	shakespeare	shakespeare	1
